The more recent work deals with heat transfer from surfaces that have more complex shapes than previously considered, with heat transfer in situations in which laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow occur; in situations where the surface is inclined at a relatively small angle to the horizontal; and in situations where there is a covering surface above the heated surface.

It comprehensively re-examines Neurath’s scientific, philosophical and educational contributions from a range of standpoints including historical, sociological and problem-oriented perspectives. Leading Neurath scholars disentangle and connect Neurath’s works, ideas and ideals and evaluate them both in their original socio-historical context and in contemporary philosophical debates. Readers will discover a new critical understanding. Drawing on archive materials, essays discuss not only Neurath’s better-known works from lesser-known perspectives, but also his lesser-known works from the better-known perspective of their place in his overall philosophical oeuvre. Reflecting the full range of Neurath's work, this volume has a broad appeal. Besides scholars and researchers interested in Neurath, Carnap, the Vienna Circle, work on logical empiricism and the history and philosophy of science, this book will also appeal to graduate students in philosophy, sociology, history and education. Readers will find Neurath’s thoughts described and evaluated in an accessible manner, making it a good read for those beyond the academic world such as social leaders and activists. The book includes the edited 1940-45 Neurath-Carnap correspondence and the English translation of Neurath's logic papers.""]",,,,left_only

It argues that exile, in the Palestinian case especially, is a political catastrophe; it is banishment by a colonial power. It suggests that, unlike expatriation (a choice of a foreign land over one’s own), exile is a political rather than an artistic concept and is forced rather than voluntary — while exile can be emancipatory, it is always an unwelcome loss. In addition to its historical dimension, exile also entails a different perception of return to expatriation. This book frames expatriates as quintessentially American, particularly intellectuals and artists seeking a space of creativity and social dissidence in the experience of living away from home. At the heart of both literary discourses, however, is a preoccupation with home, belonging, identity, language, mobility and homecoming.""]",,,,left_only

In his newest book, Beneficial Effects of Fish Oil on Human Brain, Dr. Akhlaq A. Farooqui expands on the status and therapeutic importance of n-3 fatty acids (major components of fish oil) and their mediators in normal brain and those with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Farooqui presents the benefits of n-3 fatty acids on Western diet, which is enriched in n-6 fatty acids (major components of vegetable oil) and may promote the above neurological disorders. The book will present readers with cutting edge and comprehensive information on metabolism and roles of neural membrane n-3 fatty acids. Neuroscientists, clinicians, neurologists, neuropathologists, opthamologists, dietitians, and nutritionists will find this book useful for understanding the molecular basis of n-3 fatty acids and their lipid mediators (resolvins and neuroprotectins) in neuroprotection in acute neural trauma (stroke, spinal cord trauma and head injury) and neurodegenerative diseases. About the Author: Dr. Akhlaq A. Farooqui is a leader in the field of brain phospholipases A2, bioactive ether lipid metabolism, polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid-, sphingolipid-, and cholesterol-derived lipid mediators, and glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. He has discovered the stimulation of plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 (PlsEtn-PLA2) and diacyl- and monoacylglycerol lipases in brains from patients with Alzheimer disease. Stimulation of PlsEtn-PLA2 produces plasmalogen deficiency and increases levels of eicosanoids that may be related to the loss of synapses in brains of patients with Alzheimer disease. Dr. Farooqui has published cutting edge research on the generation and identification of glycerophospholipid-, sphingolipid-, and cholesterol-derived lipid mediators in kainic acid neurotoxicity by lipidomics. He has previously authored four monographs: Glycerophospholipids in Brain: Phospholipase A2 in Neurological Disorders (2007); Neurochemical Aspects of Excitotoxicity (2008); Metabolism and Functions of Bioactive Ether Lipids in Brain (2008); and Hot Topics in Neural Membrane Lipidology (2009).

It shows how early frustrations as a policy-maker enabled him to glimpse the cliff-edges other macro-modellers missed, and re-arm ‘Keynesian’ theory against the orthodoxy that had tried to absorb it. Godley gained notoriety for his economic commentaries - foreseeing the malaise of the 1970s, the Reagan-Thatcher slump, the unsustainable 1980s and 1990s booms, and the crises in the Eurozone and world economies after 2008. This foresight arose from a series of advances in his understanding of national accounting, price-setting, the role of modern finance, and the use of economic data, especially to grasp the interlinkage of stocks and flows. This biography also gives due attention to Godley's life outside academic economics – including his chaotic childhood, truncated career as a professional oboist, equally brief stints as a sculptor’s model and economist in industry, and a longer spell as as a Treasury adviser with a mystery gift for forecasting. This first full-length biography traces Wynne Godley’s long career from professional musician to public servant, policymaker, tormentor of conventional macroeconomics and creator of a workable alternative – all after escaping a childhood of decaying mansions and draconian schools, and rescuing his private world from the legacy of two Freuds. Drawing on Godley’s published and unpublished work and extensive interviews with those who knew him, the author explores Godley's improbable life and explains the lasting significance of his work.""]",,,,left_only

Drawing upon a wide range of methodological approaches in contemporary political and social theory, it explores how the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis represents the opening of possibilities for resistance and examines the structural hurdles facing radical politics in effectively challenging neoliberalism. The author challenges the dominant conceptions of democratic politics by critically interrogating the role of liberalism in the depoliticisation of governing and the neoliberal restructuring of the democratic role of the state. The trajectory of new radical left parties in Slovenia, Greece and Spain is used to demonstrate the need to overcome the binary divide between institutional politics and resistance in radical political theory and practice.']",,,,left_only

Emphasis is given to a general applicability of the developed method to industrial tasks such as gluing or welding. Minimum-time trajectories may yield economic advantages as a shorter trajectory duration results in a lower task cycle time. Whereas kinematically redundant manipulators possess increased dexterity, compared to conventional non-redundant manipulators, their inverse kinematics is not unique and requires further treatment. In this work a joint space decomposition approach is introduced that takes advantage of the closed form inverse kinematics solution of non-redundant robots. Kinematic redundancy can be fully exploited to achieve minimum-time trajectories for prescribed end-effector paths.

Ryff and Chiara Ruini This unique theory-to-practice volume presents far-reaching advances in positive and existential therapy, with emphasis on meaning-making as central to coping and resilience, growth and positive change. Innovative meaning-based strategies are presented with clients facing medical and mental health challenges such as spinal cord injury, depression, and cancer. Diverse populations and settings are considered, including substance abuse, disasters, group therapy, and at-risk youth. Contributors demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of meaning-making interventions by addressing novel findings in this rapidly growing and promising area. By providing broad international and interdisciplinary perspectives, it enhances empirical findings and offers valuable practical insights. Such a diverse and varied examination of meaning encourages the reader to integrate his or her thoughts from both existential and positive psychology perspectives, as well as from clinical and empirical approaches, and guides the theoretical convergence to a unique point of understanding and appreciation for the value of meaning and its pursuit. Included in the coverage: · The proper aim of therapy: Subjective well-being, objective goodness, or a meaningful life? · Character strengths and mindfulness as core pathways to meaning in life · The significance of meaning to conceptualizations of resilience and posttraumatic growth · Practices of meaning-making interventions: A comprehensive matrix · Working with meaning in life in chronic or life-threatening disease · Strategies for cultivating purpose among adolescents in clinical settings · Integrative meaning therapy: From logotherapy to existential positive interventions · Multiculturalism and meaning in existential and positive psychology · Nostalgia as an existential intervention: Using the past to secure meaning in the present and the future · The spiritual dimension of meaning Clinical Perspectives on Meaning redefines these core healing objectives for researchers, students, caregivers, and practitioners from the fields of existential psychology, logotherapy, and positive psychology, as well as for the interested public. .']",,,,left_only

It demonstrates that British colonizers, Indian and Chinese laborers, and formerly enslaved Africans negotiated struggles for political and economic power through the performance of masculinity and the control of migrant women, and that even those authors who critique empire often reinforce patriarchy as they do so. Further, it identifies a common thread within the work of those authors who resist the hierarchies of empire: a poetics of kinship, or, a focus on the importance of building familial ties across generations and across classifications of people.']",,,,left_only

This ground-breaking text re-examines the purpose of society and the role of economics in it, arguing that the absence of a beneficial natural order calls for the role of the collective in social and economic life to be revisited. Drawing on some key figures marking milestones in the evolution of social and economic thinking, the author offers a critique of mainstream economics as a way of thinking and as a provider of guiding principles for economic and social organisation. Volume I introduces the reader to the emergence of natural order; considers the internal logic of economics and how it managed to be so persuasive in its recommendation for competitive interactions to govern all aspects of social life in all societies and across them; demonstrates that the economic conception of an order which solves society’s economic problem is, in fact, an impossibility that turns the natural phenomenon of markets into a problem rather than an ideal; and, addresses the other apparent appeal of markets: their association with the ideas of freedom and justice. This is a bold and foundational new work that offers an original and innovative perspective on economics and its challenges, addressing core areas such as behavioural economics, evolutionary game theory and links between social sciences (anthropology, philosophy) and neurosciences.”.']",,,,left_only

It explores the political contexts and internal dynamics of indigenous movements, to show that they created different opportunities for women to organize and voice specific demands. This, in turn, led to various forms of organizational autonomy for women involved in indigenous movements. The trajectories vary from the creation of autonomous spaces within mixed-gender organizations to the creation of independent organizations. Another pattern is that of women’s organizations maintaining an affiliation to a male-dominated mixed-gender organization, or what the authors call “gender parallelism”.

These are as follows: Aid levels (meaning if aid is too low or too high); Domestic political institutions (including political stability and extent of decentralisation); Aid composition (including sectors, modalities, objectives and time horizons); and Aid volatility and fragmentation.

It expands current debates on multilingualism, asking which signs are in use and in action, and what are their social, political, and historical implications. The volume’s starting-point is Bakhtin’s ‘heteroglossia’, a key concept in understanding the tensions, conflicts, and multiple voices within, among, and between those signs. The chapters provide illuminating accounts of language practices as they bring into play, both in practice and in pedagogy, voices which index students’ localities, social histories, circumstances, and identities. The book documents the performance of linguistic repertoires in an era of profound social change caused by the shifting nature of nation-states, increased movement of people across territories, and growing digital communication. ""Our thinking on language and multilingualism is expanding rapidly.\xa0 Up until recently we have tended to regard languages as bounded entities, and multilingualism has been understood as knowing more than one language. Working with the concept of heteroglossia, researchers are developing alternative perspectives that treat languages as sets of resources for expressing meaning that can be drawn on by speakers in communicatively productive ways in different contexts.\xa0 These perspectives raise fundamental questions about the myriad of ways of knowing and using language(s).\xa0\xa0\xa0 This collection brings together the contributions of many of the key researchers in the field.\xa0 It will provide an authoritative reference point for contemporary interpretations of ‘heteroglossia’ and valuable accounts of how ‘translanguaging’ can be explored and exploited in the fields of education and cultural studies.""\xa0Professor Constant Leung, King’s College London, UK.']",,,,left_only

The authors thoroughly review what is known about how such activity affects the endocrine system and how in turn these hormonal responses affect many other organs and systems of the body. In addition, aspects of endocrinology in non-glandular tissue which have endocrine actions are addressed; for example, adipocytes and the release of leptin and related adipocytokines. Further, a wide range of clinically related topics such as athletic amenorrhea, osteopenia, sarcopenia, and hypogonadism are included.

Remarkably, the author shows how to calculate arbitrarily high orders of derivatives of Dirichlet's energy defined on the infinite dimensional manifold of all surfaces spanning a contour, breaking new ground in the Calculus of Variations, where normally only the second derivative or variation is calculated.\xa0 The monograph begins with easy examples leading to a proof in a large number of cases that can be presented in a graduate course in either manifolds or complex analysis.

Also more and more attention is being paid to the evolution of collections of inter-related and inter-dependent software projects, be it in the form of web systems, software product families, software ecosystems, or systems of systems. With this book, the editors present insightful contributions on these and other domains currently being intensively explored, written by renowned researchers in the respective fields of software evolution. Each chapter presents the state of the art in a particular topic, as well as the current research, available tool support, and remaining challenges. The book is complemented by a glossary of important terms used in the community, a reference list of nearly 1,000 papers and books, and tips on additional resources that may be useful to the reader (reference books, journals, standards and major scientific events in the domain of software evolution, and datasets). This book is intended for all those interested in software engineering, and more particularly, software maintenance and evolution. Researchers and software practitioners alike will find in the contributed chapters an overview of the most recent findings, covering a broad spectrum of software evolution topics.

The idea of the book crystallized during the long journey of the Editors on various facets of water issues in India and abroad during their extended association, at all levels with the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, as well as International Organizations dealing with water. Currently water-stressed, India is likely to become water scarce in not too distant a future. The global freshwater supply and its sustainable use for human consumption, and conservation of the ecosystem have never come under such a rigorous scrutiny before. The unplanned and reckless exploitation of this precious resource have led to a crisis situation, compounded by a real threat of climate change. This book is, therefore, timely and of particular relevance not only to India but the entire world. The book contains 20 chapters, beside the lead article by the Editors. The chapters are contributed by the eminent professionals, researchers, academicians and civil society representatives having an in-depth understanding of the issues. The contents of the chapters have been chosen to represent all aspects of water. The assessment of water resources using satellite data and in-depth analyses of groundwater sector like, the Aquifer Mapping Programme initiated by Government of India, application of gravity satellite data to assess the resource build up, artificial recharge of aquifers and its contamination, are dealt with by eminent experts. The articles on sustainable management of water through good governance by community participation and involvement of civil society are placed. Flood management both through a basin level approach as well as by building resilience in vulnerable areas is discussed. Other critical issues like water bodies management, constitutional provisions, water governance and financial issues, hydro-power and need of research and development in this sector are also dealt with aptly. In view of emerging crisis and complexities in this sector the future pathways and the paradigm shift that is required in administrative and policy level is also discussed.']",,,,left_only

The authors trace the ideology of scientism to the early faith Auguste Comte placed in science and the scientific method as a panacea to all human problem solving. By revealing many of the epistemological problems confronted by the social sciences, including education, the authors undermine the prevailing view that a science of education is possible or desirable. Besides revealing the epistemological problems associated with education research, they suggest that the instrumentalism and micro level responsibility related to scientism in education constitute a manipulative ideological smokescreen to distract public attention away from the structural inequities that generate disparate academic outcomes among students in industrialized democracies. The book deals a severe blow to the belief that science is a suitable lens through which to view or strengthen educational practice. ""One begins this book with the skeptical belief that it can’t be right. The task of reading, then, is to locate where Hyslop-Margison goes wrong to reach his radical and disturbing conclusions. At the very least, even the most skeptical will have to recognize that the unsayable—that current educational research has proven largely fruitless for discernable reasons—is certainly plausible. He brilliantly brings an issue that has been considered too eccentric to contemplate into the heart of current educational discourse. Everyone concerned with educational research—researchers and those policy-makers, administrators, and other educational workers who draw on the products of educational research should read this important book carefully.""

This book explores the relation between visual motifs and cultural representation in a range of key films by James Ivory, Martin Scorsese and Jane Campion, among others. Looking at the mannerist taste for citation, detail and stylisation, the author argues for an aesthetic of fragments and figures central to the period film as an international genre. Three key figures - the house, the tableau and the letter - structure a critical journey through a selection of detailed case studies, in relation to changing notions of visual style, melodrama, and gender. This seeks to place this popular but often undervalued genre in a new light and to rethink its significance in the context of key debates in film studies.""--Publisher\'s website.']",,,,left_only

There is a new environment of conflict in the post-9/11 age, in which there appears to be emerging threats to security and stability in the shape of individuals and groups holding or espousing radical views about religion, ideology, often represented in the media as oppositional to Western values. This book asks what, if anything is new about these radicalising discourses, how and why they relate to political acts of violence and terror, and what the role of the mass media is in promoting or hindering them. This includes exploring how the acts themselves and explanations for them on the web are picked up and represented in mainstream television news media or Big Media, through the journalistic and editorial uses of words, phrases, graphics, images, and videos. It analyses how interpretations of the term \'radicalisation\' are shaped by news representations through investigating audience responses, understandings and misunderstandings.

Entrepreneurship is critical to this growth—entrepreneurs recognize the potential of new ideas, design applications, develop new products, and successfully bring products to market. They build companies and create jobs, generating new opportunities for wealth creation. An often overlooked opportunity for entrepreneurship is the market segment known as emerging domestic markets (EDM). These low- to moderate-income communities, ethnic- and women-owned firms, and underinvested urban areas represent a rapidly growing component of the U.S. population. Smart investors seeking untapped opportunities are homing in on such markets. Visionary policy-makers recognize that given current demographic trends, America’s national economic health depends increasingly on the vitality of EDM businesses. At the same time, it is clear that fostering entrepreneurship in emerging domestic markets is challenging on many levels. Entrepreneurship in Emerging Domestic Markets: Barriers and Innovation explores the key issues surrounding EDM entrepreneurship. Leading researchers and practitioners from the fields of finance, entrepreneurship, economics, and government delve into data to identify the significant stumbling blocks and pose workable solutions. With this volume, the editors aim to provide scholars, investors, policy-makers, advocates, and the business community a tool to help leverage the significant entrepreneurial resources in emerging domestic markets. ""What a refreshing and important volume! The reader will learn, contrary to some microcredit adherents, that not everyone is an entrepreneur, and that new businesses started by poor people fail at an exceptionally high rate. Net result: perhaps credit is overestimated as a solution to poverty. Instead, the poor need secure, well-paying jobs, which is what real entrepreneurs can provide. What does it take, and what has it taken in the past, to encourage these entrepreneurs? What has stymied their progress? Barth, Yago, and Zeidman have gathered a set of papers that you will want to read."" Gerard Caprio, Jr. Professor, Economics Department and Chair Center for Development Economics, Williams College ""This book advances our understanding of the complexity and intractability of economic development in emerging U.S. domestic markets. Its underlying thesis is both intuitively appealing and sustained by research reported here: entrepreneurs are most likely to be the transformational leaders in these markets. Thoughtful practitioners, government policy-makers, and academic researchers will find this volume to be a stimulus to sound reflection."" Robert F. Bruner Dean and Charles C.

These include: corporate governance, strategic governance and operational governance. The book unifies traditional corporate governance, leadership, and strategic management processes, whilst seeking to understand what actually happens on the ground to keep the organisation working and delivering ongoing value to its stakeholders. It synthesises these separate streams into a unified enterprise governance framework, posing some challenging questions whilst providing clear insight into how you implement enterprise governance: something that helps deliver on the 7 As and ultimately high performance. \xa0 “This book will be a great asset for various stakeholders, including business leaders, NGOs, not-for-profit entities or any other form of organisations that wishes to prosper over the longer term. … It is an easy read and includes a take-away at the end of key chapters. “ Dr Vijay Pereira, Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) and Leader in Knowledge Services (Organisational Studies and HRM), Portsmouth Business School, University of Portsmouth, UK \xa0 “Corporate governance has been in the spotlight as regulators grapple with the consequences of the financial crisis.

Sports injuries are among the most commonly presenting issues in emergency rooms and physician’s offices. During these events, the most common injuries affect the skin. Cutaneous manifestations afflict all athletes from the recreational neophyte to the professional. Conditions ranging from innocuous skin injuries to skin disease that can bench a nationally ranked wrestling team occur with alarming frequency. Review articles and book chapters that discuss sports-related dermatoses are too general and often offer only cursory information. SPORTS DERMATOLOGY: HANDBOOK OF DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT gathers the most clinically relevant and badly needed information in this emerging area of sports dermatology. With the increased emphasis on evidence-based medicine, that construct serves as the basis for much of the book, providing the most current and practical approach for treatment options. Both common and unusual disorders related to sports are reviewed in detail. Each sports-related skin condition is discussed with attention to the following subheadings: epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The author has separated the sports-related dermatoses into categories including infections, benign and malignant neoplasms, traumatic conditions, environmental hazards, and inflammatory reactions. On the inside covers of the book, for quick reference and easy access, we have listed dermatologic conditions affecting athletes, first by sport and then by specific skin condition. Photographs of the sports-related dermatoses will help the clinician visualize the different clinical morphologies apparent in athletes. In many cases, the use of summary tables will help the clinician organize their thinking regarding prevention and treatment of various infectious conditions. SPORTS DERMATOLOGY will assist the many clinicians faced with these issues to chose the most appropriate treatment and prevention plan for their specific athlete population.']",,,,left_only

Prior to this book, very little was known about how tabloid journalists operate in Africa. The book first explores the global practice of journalism and then focuses on tabloid journalism – finally situating the discussion within the African context. As well as concentrating on how tabloid journalism can be seen as part of the broader neo-liberal thinking in Africa, in which democracy and freedom of expression is promoted, it also looks at how tabloid journalism practice has been met with resistance from the alliance of forces. Chama draws on examples from across the continent looking at success stories and struggles within the sometime infotainment genre. Tabloid Journalism in Africa concludes that even though challenges exist, there is a strong case to suggest that the practice of tabloid journalism is being readily accepted by many people as part of the unique voices of democracy – even those which might be shocking yet true. .']",,,,left_only

It explores what African leadership is and the possible effects it has on leaders, followers, and organizations across the continent. While some maintain that leadership of and within Africa presents too many challenges, this book argues that Africa is ripe with potential and on the verge of an African Renaissance. This book looks beyond socioeconomic factors to explore different perspectives of leadership such as holistic, transformational, and servant leadership, as well as values and ethics. Taking a philosophical and pragmatic approach, this edited collection provides insight from African-born leadership scholars to deliver a first-hand account of the challenges the continent faces. Their unique experiences and immersion in the African world pave the way for a revival of leadership through a lens of history, tradition, economics, societal, and leadership perspectives.']",,,,left_only

With the “theory” vision, the existing knowledge system for IWRM is reorganized in order to supplement new theories related to our society and science. We then introduce two distinctive case studies on how to achieve sustainable water management. Based on the “social implementation” vision, one study is carried out by the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature on Indonesia’s Bali Island, where there is a long history of educational and inspirational local-level water management systems with multistakeholder participation. A further study is based on the “harmony between science and society” vision, and the Ritsumeikan-Global Innovation Research Organization, Ritsumeikan University, proposes innovative water recycling system for the sustainable development of Chongming Island, an eco-island that belongs to China. These two studies highlight “science with society”, a new perspective on science that could promisingly lead to more sustainable futures.

Yet, according to a provocative new book, mental health systems often reinforce the depressive disorders they aim to treat. In Depression and Globalization, Carl Walker analyzes the human cost of recent political and economic events as main contributors to the rise of depression, particularly in the U.S. and Britain. Starting in the 1980s, income and educational disparities, financial and job insecurity—by-products of multinational business—have grown in parallel with increasing feelings of hopelessness and isolation. These sociopolitical stressors, Walker asserts, have not only added to the prevalence of depressive disorders, but have profoundly influenced their conceptualization and treatment. Balancing individual lives and societal health, the author identifies challenges rarely discussed in the mental health field, and steps the community can take to improve their outcome. Included in the coverage: The stigma of depression in the context of recent political and economic events. The trickle-down mental health effects of global politics. The ""depression industry"": its economic context, and how its biological and individual emphasis can contribute to patients’ core problems. Public attitudes toward depression, and how they are shaped. Community and society-wide initiatives for mental well-being, Depression and Globalization opens the debate with considerable insight, and clinicians, researchers, and policymakers will find in Walker’s work a powerful and timely prescription for change.']",,,,left_only

An international panel of experts analyzes current trends in consumer behavior across diverse countries worldwide and across cultural groups within countries, depicting commonly-used cross-cultural frameworks and research methods. \xa0Beginning with conceptualizing and quantifying culture at the national level, the volume then moves to individual levels of analysis of consumer decision-making, examining consumer data as they affect business decisions in marketing products internationally. The resulting work synthesizes the consumer science, international business, and consumer psychology literatures for a deeper understanding of all three disciplines and pathways to future research as cultures interact and tastes evolve. Among the topics covered: \xa0Culture as a driver of individual and national consumer behavior. Consumer culture-based attitudes toward buying foreign versus domestic products. Country-of-origin effects: consumer perceptions of international products. The roles of cultural influences in product branding. Cultural aspects of consumer-brand relationships. Consumer behavior in the emerging marketplace of subsistence countries. This attention to both national detail and individual nuance makes Cross-Cultural Issues in Consumer Science and Consumer Psychology an instructive and highly useful reference for scholars and students in consumer psychology, \xa0cross-cultural psychology, marketing, international business, \xa0as well as professionals in these areas.']",,,,left_only

Its central proposition is that a consistent perception of the world is crucial for the good development of any multi-robot application. The text focuses on the high-level problem of cooperative perception by a multi-robot system: the idea that, depending on what each robot sees and its current situation, it will need to communicate these things to its fellows whenever possible to share what it has found and keep updated by them in its turn. However, in any realistic scenario, distributed solutions to this problem are not trivial and need to be addressed from as many angles as possible. Distributed Consensus with Visual Perception in Multi-Robot Systems covers a variety of related topics such as: ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 distributed consensus algorithms; ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 data association and robustness problems; ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 convergence speed; and ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 cooperative mapping. The book first puts forward algorithmic solutions to these problems and then supports them with empirical validations working with real images. It provides the reader with a deeper understanding of the problems associated to the perception of the world by a team of cooperating robots with onboard cameras. Academic researchers and graduate students working with multi-robot systems, or investigating problems of distributed control or computer vision and cooperative perception will find this book of material assistance with their studies.']",,,,left_only

Although acknowledging that the research process is not always linear, the authors proceed according to a clear progression which teachers can adapt to their needs. They provide examples, narratives, questions and tasks, and give multiple ideas for establishing research questions, choosing appropriate methodologies, adapting to existing contexts, and collecting data. They also suggest possible instruments, and give clear instructions for carrying out the most common kinds of statistical procedures, and ideas for presenting, discussing, and writing up research findings. In spite of its practical bias, the book is theoretically and ethically rigorous, and contains an extensive glossary for quick and easy reference. It will appeal to trainee teachers, in-service teachers wanting to expand their own professional horizons or working for a higher qualification, and is an invaluable reference for teacher-educators and scholars.']",,,,left_only

Although divestitures are highly relevant in practice, the acquisition of business units attracts much more attention in strategic management research. Carolin Decker develops and empirically applies a framework in which business exits serve the purpose of re-establishing a firm’s previously harmed legitimacy. She suggests four types of legitimacy needs that are to be satisfied with the divestiture of a business unit and the simultaneous pursuit of strategic reorientation. The author tests the theoretical framework with secondary data on 213 business exits. Her findings support the idea that legitimacy needs drive the likelihood of fit-enhancing business exits in divesting firms.']",,,,left_only

Technical books related to CPU design are almost always written by researchers in academia or industry and tend to pick one area, CPU architecture/Bus architecture/ CMOS design that is the area of expertise of the author, and present that in great detail. Suchbooks are of great value to students and practitioners in that area. However, engineers working on CPU design need to develop an understanding of areas outside their own to be effective.

Chen explores the ways that new industrial structures and hierarchies were created and operated, using political and sociological methodologies to understand what is distinctive in the history of the Chinese corporation. This book will be of immense interest to political scientists, sociologists, China scholars, and researchers of alternative economic structures.

It is centered around two questions triggered by the global events on the stock markets since the middle of the last decade: - Why do crashes happen when in theory they should not? - How do investors deal with such crises in terms of their risk measurement and management and, as a consequence, what are the implications for the chosen investment strategies? The book presents and discusses two different approaches to finance and investing, i.e., modern portfolio theory and behavioral finance, and provides an overview of stock market anomalies and historical crashes. It is intended to serve as a comprehensive introduction to asset and risk management for bachelor’s and master’s students in this field as well as for young professionals in the asset management industry. A key part of this book are the exercises to further demonstrate the concepts presented with examples and a step-by-step business case. An Excel file with the calculations and solutions for all 17 examples as well as all business case calculations can be downloaded at extras.springer.com. In this book modern portfolio theory meets behavioral finance, resulting in new insights in state-of-the-art investing. Not only practitioners but also students and academics benefit from the combination of professional capital market experience and academic wisdom as well as the many exercises the book uses to bring the concepts alive. Especially the chapter covering recent investment trends broken down by investor type and region should prove very useful for investment professionals in the asset management industry in Europe. Highly recommended! Dr. Christian Schmitt, Managing Director, risklab GmbH – AllianzGI Global Solutions, Munich, Germany The book provides a comprehensive introduction to modern asset management and behavioral finance. Using interesting business cases and a hands-on approach with Excel exercises, the authors lead the reader to tackle the main challenges in modern asset and risk management, with a practical focus on behavioral finance. For bachelor and master students who want to get a structured and detailed introduction to asset management, risk management and behavioral finance I can highly recommend this book!

The contributions by an international team of experts in the field, address theoretical perspectives on mediated geographies, methodological challenges and opportunities posed by geographies of media, the role and significance of different media forms and organizations in relation to socio-spatial relations, the dynamism of media in local-global relations, pedagogical approaches and in-depth case studies of mediated locales. Given the theoretical and methodological diversity of this book, it will provide an important reference for geographers and other interdisciplinary scholars working in cultural and media studies, researchers in environmental studies, sociology, visual anthropology, new technologies, and political science, who seek to understand and explore the interconnections of media, space and place through the examples of specific practices and settings.']",,,,left_only

How did they spend their first years of life? Did they manage to find their way among the various educators, often slaves, who surrounded them from an early age? Was Roman education characterised by loving care or harsh discipline? What was it like to be a slave child? Were paedophilia and child labour accepted and considered \'normal\'? This book focuses on all \'forgotten\' Roman children: from child emperors to children in the slums of Rome, from young magistrates to little artisans, peasants and mineworkers. The author has managed to trace them down in a wide range of sources: literature and inscriptions, papyri, archaeological finds and ancient iconography. In Roman society, children were considered outsiders. But at the same time they carried within them all the hopes and expectations of the older generation, who wanted them to become full-fledged Romans""--Provided by publisher.']",,,,left_only

Through their powerful story of love and betrayal, interwoven with the stories of a Palestinian American women's rights activist and a U.S. soldier, journalist Christina Asquith explores one of the great untold sagas of the Iraq war:  the attempt to bring women's rights to Iraq, and the consequences for all those involved.  On the heels of the invasion, twenty-two-year-old Zia accepts a job inside the U.S. headquarters in Baghdad, trusting that democracy will shield her burgeoning romance with an American contractor from the disapproval of her fellow Iraqis.  But as resistance to the U.S. occupation intensifies, Zia and her sister, Nunu, a university student, are targeted by Islamic insurgents and find themselves trapped between their hopes for a new country and the violent reality of a misguided war.  Asquith sets their struggle against the broader U.S. efforts to bring women's rights to Iraq, weaving the sisters' story with those of Manal, a Palestinian American women's rights activist, and Heather, a U.S. army reservist, who work together to found Iraq's first women's center.  After one of their female colleagues is gunned down on a highway, Manal and Heather must decide whether they can keep fighting for Iraqi women if it means risking their own lives.  In Sisters in War, Christina Asquith introduces the reader to four women who dare to stand up for their rights in the most desperate circumstances.  With compassion and grace, she vividly reveals the plight of women living and serving in Iraq and offers us a vision of how women's rights and Islam might be reconciled.""]",,,,left_only

The author conducts focused interviews with 26 experts from the shipbuilding industry. Based on the findings of the interviews, he subsequently carries out an international survey addressed to shipyards’ management representatives. The results indicate that there is the chance for European shipyards to improve their position in the global shipbuilding industry by offering not only customized high-tech ships of best quality, but also technical service packages and therewith adding further value for their customers.

It argues for a shift in focus from measuring the effectiveness of language learning processes to humanising the language learning experience. This new paradigm explores the force of affect, the imagination and creativity and their roles in assembling language learners’ intimate worlds. ‘The personal’ is reclaimed and acts as driving force for language learning and the sphere in which learners engage both their minds and bodies in a constant socialization of feelings and emotions. The author provides examples from real language learners using a variety of modern languages to provide insights on the kind of personal worlds that languages compel us to inhabit. This book will be of interest to those working with language learning and language education theory, language teachers, and researchers and students who are interested in issues of identity and intercultural communication in language learning.

Discussion of general methods for extraction, purification and quantitation is followed by consideration of the analysis of specific important steroid groups, such as progestagens, estrogens, corticosteroids, vitamins D, bile acids and anabolic steroids and their metabolites. The editors have made a conscious decision to leave the first edition to stand on its own with regards to steroid analysis prior to 1995 and authors therefore were asked to review the modern post-1995 steroid scene, though pre-1995 data were not excluded if authors felt it was necessary.

It provides a significant extension of the existing theory of zeta functions for fractal strings to fractal sets and arbitrary bounded sets in Euclidean spaces of any dimension. Two new classes of fractal zeta functions are introduced, namely, the distance and tube zeta functions of bounded sets, and their key properties are investigated. The theory is developed step-by-step at a slow pace, and every step is well motivated by numerous examples, historical remarks and comments, relating the objects under investigation to other concepts. Special emphasis is placed on the study of complex dimensions of bounded sets and their connections with the notions of Minkowski content and Minkowski measurability, as well as on fractal tube formulas. It is shown for the first time that essential singularities of fractal zeta functions can naturally emerge for various classes of fractal sets and have a significant geometric effect. The theory developed in this book leads naturally to a new definition of fractality, expressed in terms of the existence of underlying geometric oscillations or, equivalently, in terms of the existence of nonreal complex dimensions. The connections to previous extensive work of the first author and his collaborators on geometric zeta functions of fractal strings are clearly explained. Many concepts are discussed for the first time, making the book a rich source of new thoughts and ideas to be developed further. The book contains a large number of open problems and describes many possible directions for further research. The beginning chapters may be used as a part of a course on fractal geometry. The primary readership is aimed at graduate students and researchers working in Fractal Geometry and other related fields, such as Complex Analysis, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Measure Theory, Harmonic Analysis, Mathematical Physics, Analytic Number Theory and the Spectral Theory of Elliptic Differential Operators. The book should be accessible to nonexperts and newcomers to the field.']",,,,left_only

The traditional advice is to train quickly on products, grab a customer list, start calling for appointments, discover opportunities, and close deals. In fact, almost every sales model out there is based on nothing more than ""opportunity"" management. But jumping straight to opportunity will leave salespeople chasing their tails and coming up short on payday. With an emphasis on basic sales skills that have been refreshed for today\'s generation of buyers, Trust-Based Selling shows there is a significant problem you must overcome when opening up new accounts and territories. No matter what you are selling, your prospect already has a trusted relationship with an incumbent vendor and will continue to buy from that vendor even when you have the better solution. The playing field is not level—and you’re on the wrong side. So how can you compete to win? ""Trust is the grease that makes business sales effortless,"" writes sales pro and trainer Dave Monty in this quick-read book. Opportunity metrics are important, but trust—and a few sharp insider tactics Monty reveals—is the guidepost that leads to success. Trust-Based Selling—an abridgement of Monty\'s Sales Hunting—helps you start establishing trust before you step foot in a prospect’s door, and it shows you the tactics necessary to penetrate new accounts. It also explains: The new basic sales skills as taught by master salesman Dave Monty Why trust-based relationships enable you to get and keep customers for life How to get in step with the customer’s buying cycle How to establish trust-based and traditional sales metrics to guide your efforts With advice based on Monty’s twenty years of IT sales and sales management experience—along with principles confirmed by academic research—Trust-Based Selling is a fast read that is packed with real-life examples and prescriptions for achieving sales success.

Andrews firmly establishes himself as the leading social theorist of sport in late-capitalist consumer culture. There is no better scholarly guide to the politicized and politicizing nature and influence of contemporary sports on society than Andrews’ perceptive words and always-challenging ideas. Theoretically rich and empirically grounded, Making Sport Great Again is both an intellectual and political intervention into the hyper-commodified, commercialized spectacle that is modern corporate uber-sport, a diagnostic analysis of neo-liberal sports cultures of the highest order that deserves to become an instant classic.” —Ben Carrington, Associate Professor of Sociology and Journalism, University of Southern California, USA “One of the world’s leading scholars in sport and physical cultural studies, Andrews offers an expertly crafted and potent analysis of the complex relationship between sport and politics, with particular focus on the Trump era. Highly recommended as essential reading for anyone and everyone interested in understanding the intricate webs of power relations that weave sport, politics, culture and the economy together in ways that impact bodies and minds, the world over.” —Holly Thorpe, Professor of Health, Sport and Human Performance, University of Waikato, New Zealand Blending critical theory, conjunctural cultural studies, and assemblage theory, Making Sport Great Again introduces and develops the concept of uber-sport: the sporting expression of late capitalism’s conjoined corporatizing, commercializing, spectacularizing, and celebritizing forces. On different scales and in varying spaces, the uber-sport assemblage is revealed both to surreptitiously reinscribe the neoliberal preoccupation with consumption and to nurture the individualized consumer subject. Andrews further probes how uber-sport normalizes the ideological orientations and associate affective investments of the Trump assemblage’s authoritarian populism. Even as it articulates the regressive politicization of sport, Making Sport Great Again serves also as a call to action: how might progressives rearticulate uber-sport in emancipatory and actualizing political formations? .']",,,,left_only

This book argues that that is not an adequate way to view Goodman. The separate disciplines of ontology, epistemology, and aesthetics should be viewed as sequential steps within his thought, such that each provides the ground rules for the next section and, furthermore, providing the reasons for limitations on the terms available to the subsequent writing(s). This is true not merely because this is the general chronology of his writing, but more importantly because within his metaphysics lies Goodman’s basic nominalist ontology and logic, and it is upon those principles that he builds his epistemology and, furthermore, it is the sum of both the metaphysics and the epistemology, with the nominalist principle as the guiding force, which constructs the aesthetics. At the end of each section of this book, the consequent limitations imposed on his terms and concepts available to him are explicated, such that, by the end of the book, the book delineates the constraints imposed upon the aesthetics by both the metaphysics and the epistemology. ""The author has given us the needed scholarly reference work on Goodman. Goodman sought to replace psychology with semantics, and showed us how far we could travel in that direction. The trip was admirably designed and guided by his genius. In end, it was genius, and not the lack of it, that showed us that the philosophy of language and languages of art will lead us back to the hardest questions in the philosophy of mind.""

Despite the growing interest that surrounds contemporary research on empathy, Edith Stein’s phenomenological investigations have been largely neglected due to a historical tradition that tends to consider her either as Husserl’s assistant or as a martyr. However, in her phenomenological research, Edith Stein pursued critically the relation between phenomenology and psychology, focusing on the relation between affectivity, subjectivity, and personhood. Alongside phenomenologists like Max Scheler, Kurt Stavenhagen, and Hedwig Conrad-Martius, Stein developed Husserl’s method, incorporating several original modifications that are relevant for philosophy, phenomenology, and ethics. Drawing on recent debates on empathy, emotions, and collective intentionality as well as on original inquiries and interpretations, the collection articulates and develops new perspectives regarding Edith Stein’s phenomenology. The volume includes an appraisal of Stein’s philosophical relation to Edmund Husserl and Max Scheler, and develops further the concepts of empathy, sociality, and personhood. These essays demonstrate the significance of Stein’s phenomenology for contemporary research on intentionality, emotions, and ethics. Gathering together contributions from young researchers and leading scholars in the fields of phenomenology, social ontology, and history of philosophy, this collection provides original views and critical discussions that will be of interest also for social philosophers and moral psychologists.']",,,,left_only

Furthermore, the role of the presidency in the U.S., Korea, and Taiwan is quite different. Taking these variations in political systems into consideration, the authors discuss how the electoral systems are regulated in relation to issues such as paid advertisements and campaign periods.

Drawing on theories of publics/counter-publics and developing an analytical framework that allows the comparison of different country cases, this volume explores the transformation from spontaneous demonstrations, driven by civic outrage against injustice to more institutionalized forms of protest. Presenting comparative research and case studies on e.g. the Portuguese Generation in Trouble, the Arab Spring in Northern Africa, or Occupy Wall Street in the USA, the authors explore how protest publics emerge and evolve in very different ways – from creating many small citizen groups focused on particular projects to more articulated political agendas for both state and society. These protest publics have provoked and legitimized concrete socio-political changes, altering the balance of power in specific political spaces, and in some cases generating profound moments of instability that can lead both to revolutions and to peaceful transformations of political institutions. The authors argue that this recent wave of protests is driven by a new type of social actor: self-organized publics. In some cases these protest publics can lead to democratic reform and redistributive policies, while in others they can produce destabilization, ethnic and nationalist populism, and authoritarianism. This book will help readers to better understand how seemingly spontaneous public events and protests evolve into meaningful, well-structured collective action and come to shape political processes in diverse regions of the globe.']",,,,left_only

Using Henry Mintzberg’s “Myths of Healthcare” as a springboard, it reveals management practices that undermine care delivery, explores their cultural and corporate origins, and details how they may be reversed through changes in management strategy, organization, scale, and style. Tackling conventional wisdom about decision-making, cost-effectiveness, service quality, and equity, contributors fine-tune concepts of mission and vision by promoting collaboration, engagement, and common sense. The book’s multidisciplinary panel of experts analyzes the most popular healthcare management “myths,” among them: ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The healthcare system is failing. ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The healthcare system can be fixed through social engineering. ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Healthcare institutions can be fixed by bringing in the heroic leader. ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The healthcare system can be fixed by treating it more as a business. ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Healthcare is rightly left to the private sector, for the sake of efficiency. The Myths of Health Care speaks to a large, diverse audience: scholars of all levels interested in the research in health policy and management, graduate and under-graduate students attending courses in leadership and management of public sector organization, and practitioners in the field of health care.']",,,,left_only

The challenges for liquid lubricants arise in extreme environmental conditions, such as very high or low temperatures, vacuum, radiation, and extreme contact pressure. At these conditions, solid lubricants may be the alternative choice which can help to decrease friction and wear without incorporating liquid lubricants. Challenges with solid lubricants are to maintain a continuous supply of solid lubricants on the contact surfaces to act as lubricous layer between two sliding surfaces. Such a continuous supply of solid lubricant is more easily maintained in the case of liquid lubricants when compared to solid lubricants. The most innovative development to ensure a continuous supply of solid lubricant to the contact surface during sliding is to introduce solid lubricant as reinforcement into the matrix of one of the sliding components. Composite materials are engineered or naturally occurring materials which contain two or more distinct constituents with significantly different chemical, physical and mechanical properties. Composites consist of reinforcement and matrix (metal, polymer and ceramics). Among various reinforcements, recent emerging material, solid lubricant, is found to have many favorable attributes such as good self-lubricant property. Self‐lubrication is the ability of material to transfer embedded solid lubricants to the contact surface to decrease wear rate and friction in the absence of an external lubricant. Self-lubricating metal matrix composites (SLMMCs) are an important category of engineering materials that are increasingly replacing a number of conventional materials in the automotive, aerospace, and marine industries due to superior tribological properties. In SLMMCs, solid lubricant materials including carbonous materials, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are embedded into the metal matrices as reinforcements to manufacture a novel material with attractive self-lubricating properties. Several studies have been investigated the tribological properties of self-lubricating materials. This book fills that gap to have a reference book about self-lubricating materials and their properties to help scientists, engineers, and industries. This book will try to discuss technically about self-lubricating materials and their properties and the applications for industries. The chapters will be written by authoritative expertise in the field. Additionally, this book will demonstrate fundamental study and most advanced innovations in self-lubricating materials as regards to friction and wear. The chapters also include tribological properties of composites and coatings and some practical application of self-lubricating materials.']",,,,left_only

Recent years have seen an exponential growth in knowledge about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of antibody activity. These new results dramatically changed our view of how antibodies function in vivo. The importance of this class of molecules is demonstrated by the heightened susceptibility to infections of humans and mice with an altered capacity to generate pathogen specific antibody responses. Thus, the majority of our currently available vaccines, such as vaccines against influenza, measles and hepatitis focus on the generation of long lasting antibody responses. Recent evidence from a variety of in vivo model systems and from human patient cohorts has highlighted the exclusive role of cellular Fc-receptors for certain immunoglobulin isotypes and subclasses. With the recent discovery of a human Fc-receptor for IgM all different human immunoglobulin isotypes now have a cellular receptor, providing a feedback mechanism and link between antibodies and the cellular components of the immune system. Moreover it has become clear the complement and Fc-receptor system are tightly connected and regulate each other to ensure a well balanced immune response. Among the immunoglobulin isotypes IgG plays a very important protective role against microbial infections and also as a therapeutic agent to kill tumor cells or autoantibody producing B cells in autoimmune disease. Transfer of our knowledge about the crucial function of Fc-receptors has led to the production of a second generation of therapeutic antibodies with enhanced binding to this class of receptors. Binding of antibodies to Fc-receptors leads to the recruitment of the potent pro-inflammatory effector functions of cells from the innate immune system. Hence, Fc-receptors link the innate and adaptive immune system, emphasizing the importance of both arms of the immune system and their crosstalk during anti-microbial immune responses. Besides this pro-inflammatory activity immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules are long known to also have an anti-inflammatory function. This is demonstrated by the use of high dose intravenous immunoglobulins as a therapeutic agent in many human autoimmune diseases. During the past five years several new insights into the molecular and cellular pathways of this anti-inflammatory activity were gained radically changing our view of IgG function in vivo. Several lines of evidence suggest that the sugar moiety attached to the IgG molecule is responsible for these opposing activities and may be seen as a molecular switch enabling the immune system to change IgG function from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory activity. There is convincing evidence in mice and humans that aberrant IgG glycosylation could be an important new pathway for understanding the impaired antibody activity during autoimmune disease. Besides this tremendous increase in basic knowledge about factors influencing immunoglobulin activity the book will also provide insights into how these new insights might help to generate novel therapeutic approaches to enhance IgG activity for tumor therapy on the one hand, and how to block the self-destructive activity of IgG autoantibodies during autoimmune disease on the other hand.']",,,,left_only

The author argues that transnational companies face a twofold challenge: managing global knowledge networks and multicultural project teams on the one hand; and interacting and collaborating across boundaries using global communication technologies, on the other. The author also argues that this dual challenge calls for the creation of a business excellence program that fits and thrives within these multicultural environments. In response, he reviews corporate practices in quality management and business excellence frameworks that have been extensively used on a transnational scale to drive organizational performance. The book approaches quality management as an element that is no longer a choice, but has now become a necessity if companies want to compete in highly globalized environments.']",,,,left_only

It brings together a group of expert authors covering topics from forest management, operations and engineering, to socio-economics and energy policy perspectives. It thus covers practical issues such as silviculture, harvesting, processing, comparative cost estimates, public policy tools and market effects. As such the book provides a comprehensive review of the complex dimensions of wood energy as well as practical guidance for professionals, researchers and advanced students. It will also provide invaluable guidance for economic development agencies, practitioners and policy-makers, when evaluating the impacts of wider wood energy adoption as part of a strategy for sustainable energy generation.

These wide-ranging essays trace the constant reconsideration of the utopian project itself over the past four decades, from its mid-twentieth century period of decline to its revival in counter-cultural science fiction of the 1960s and \'70s, its second decline with the ""dystopian turn"" in film, and the rise of feminist pessimism in the 1980s. These pages reveal what popular utopian, dystopian, and science-fiction narratives tell us about today\'s most pressing political issues, including gender equity, education reform, technological change, capitalist excess, state-sanctioned violence, and the challenges of effecting lasting political change. Through analyses of various popular genres and media, the author demonstrates how utopian visions written from particular political perspectives transcend narrowly partisan concerns to stoke our collective desire for another world and a more adequate human future, teaching us how to become the citizens and subjects that a utopian society demands""--']",,,,left_only

Written by the leading scholar on Forrest-Thomson’s work, this study explores Forrest-Thomson’s published work as well as unpublished materials from the Veronica Forrest-Thomson Archive. Drawing on close readings of Forrest-Thomson’s writings, this study argues that her work enables us reevaluate literary-critical history and suggests new paradigms for the literary aesthetics and poetics of the future.']",,,,left_only

Through a combination of new and previously published essays charting business developments from the nineteenth century onward, the author demonstrates how multinational corporations have driven globalization through the transfer of innovation and cultural values. The selected essays cover a range of topics, including studies of global industries and major corporations including Beiersdorf and Unilever. Additional chapters explore economic and corporate development in specific countries, such as India, Iran and Turkey. Merging rich historical evidence with discussion of the current state of global business, this book reveals how examining entrepreneurial activity and multinational strategies deepen explanations of global patterns of wealth and poverty.

It highlights the advantages of the rule-based approach for economic analysis by linking different methodological underpinnings. Using these, the author exemplifies how rule-based economics allows a systematic analysis of the entrepreneur as the key figure in bringing about economic change and diversity. The book includes an empirical methodology for applied research in rule-based economics, which it puts to the test in an empirical study of entrepreneurship in contemporary Japan. The choice of entrepreneurship and Japan showcases the integrative power that rule-based economics brings to further breaking a theoretical deadlock and to analytically capturing a very particular economy investigated very little so far. By offering a body of new and original research, the monograph shows how the idea of entrepreneurship as a rule helps to resolve the Schumpeter-Kirzner divide and to develop an empirical approach to the determinants of entrepreneurial activity.']",,,,left_only

The volumes expound the contribution of the German tradition to the rise of social policy in the Western world in the 19th and 20th centuries. Germany pioneered modern social policy in the 19th century when Bismarck introduced social insurance. After the Second World War, Germany’s Social Market Economy became a model of social integration. The volumes cover the history of ideas (volume 1), the legal and political history before and after 1945 (volumes 2 and 3), the German Democratic Republic (1949-1990) and the impact of German reunification (1990) (volume 4). Volume 5 embeds the German case in a major comparative study of European welfare states, complemented by a study of the USA and the Soviet Union. The volumes also yield insights into general theoretical issues of social policy beyond the empirical case of Germany. Each volume has an introduction by the editor who summarizes the contribution made by the volumes and looks into the future of German social policy. This book provides a comprehensive analysis of social policy in the German Democratic Republic (GDR, 1949-1990), followed by an analysis of the “Social Union”, the transformation of social policy in the process of German unification in 1990. Schmidt’s analysis of the GDR also depicts commonalities and differences between the welfare state in East and West Germany as well as in other East European and Western countries. He concludes that the GDR was unable to cope with the trade-off between ambitious social policy goals and a deteriorating economic performance. Ritter embeds his analysis of the Social Union in a general study of German unification, its international circumstances and its domestic repercussions (1989-1994). He argues that social policy played a pivotal role in German unification, and that there was no alternative to extending the West German welfare state to the East. Ritter, a distinguished historian, bases his contribution on an award-winning study for which he drew on archival sources and interviews with key actors.

Despite this, however, a significant degree of health inequality is emerging among different socioeconomic groups. Assessment-of-need procedures and eligibility rules define the target population in ‘need-of-care’, and represent a compulsory gateway for elderly adults in order to receive home-care benefits, either in-kind or in-cash. In this context, the economic relevance of formal long-term care has been growing and the rates of care-dependent older people in need of long-term care are estimated to increase in the forthcoming decades. The authors of this volume compare micro-data from SHARE (the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) and ELSA (the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing) across Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom’s England and Wales, where eligibility rules are care-blind. They critically review long-term care regulations in Europe, offering a detailed taxonomy of the role and the characteristics of vulnerability-evaluations and eligibility criteria. This book is of interest to academics in health economics and social policy, managers in the health sector, policy makers and professionals interested in the design, implementation and evaluation of long-term care policies. It could also be used to support different courses in the fields of ageing, health economics and policy evaluation.']",,,,left_only

They provide a vivid picture of literary life in the capital of the Aragonese seaborne empire, based in southern Italy and the Western Mediterranean. This first volume contains the two earliest of Pontano\'s five dialogues. Charon, set in the underworld of classical mythology, illustrates humanist attitudes to a wide range of topics, satirizing the follies and superstitions of humanity. Antonius, a Menippean satire named for the founder of the Neapolitan Academy, Antonio Beccadelli, is set in the Portico Antoniano in downtown Naples, where the academicians commemorate and emulate their recently-deceased leader, conversing on favorite topics and stopping from time to time to interrogate passersby.

The expanding array of new targeting molecules (recombinant antibodies or peptides) may increase the therapeutic efficacy. The title of this book ""Targeted Radionuclide Tumor Therapy – Biological aspects"" was selected to reinforce the concept that a major focus was devoted to understanding the biological effects of targeting and radiation. Furthermore, our rapidly expanding knowledge of low dose-rate effects, different types of cell death, autosensitization and the increasingly likely existence of cancer stem cells suggests to us that even more efficient approaches in targeting might be possible in the future. The development of targeted therapy is a true multidisciplinary enterprise involving physician scientists from the fields of nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, diagnostic radiology, surgery, gynaecology, pathology and medical oncology/haematology. It also involves many preclinical scientists working with experimental animal models, immunochemistry, recombinant antibody technologies, radiochemistry, radiation physics and basic cell biology. It is the ambition of the editors to enable deeper insights in the process of improving targeted therapy.

Gender studies and feminist approaches to literature have become busy and enlightening fields of enquiry in recent times, yet there remains no single work that fully analyses the impact of women\x92s surgery on literary production or, conversely, ways in which literary trends have shaped the course of gynaecology and other branches of women\x92s medicine. This book will demonstrate how fiction and medicine have a long-established tradition of looking towards each other for inspiration and elucidation in questions of gender. Medical textbooks and pamphlets have consistently cited fictional plots and characterisations as a way of communicating complex or \x91sensitive\x92 ideas. Essays explore historical accounts of clinical procedures, the relationship between gynaecology and psychology, and cultural conceptions of motherhood, fertility, and the female organisation through a broad range of texts including Henry More\x92s Pre-Existency of the Soul (1659), Charlotte Brontë\x92s Villette (1855), and Eve Ensler\x92s Vagina Monologues (1998). The Female Body in Medicine and Literature raises important theoretical questions on the relationship between popular culture, literature, and the growth of women\x92s medicine and will be required reading for scholars in gender studies, literary studies and the history of medicine. This collection explores the complex intersections between literature and the medical treatment of women between 1600 and 2000. Employing a range of methodologies, it furthers our understanding of the development of women\x92s medicine and comments on its wider cultural ramifications. Although there has been an increase in critical studies of women\x92s medicine in recent years, this collection is a key contributor to that field because it draws together essays on a wide range of new topics from varying disciplines. It features, for instance, studies of motherhood, fertility, clinical procedure, and the relationship between gynaecology and psychology. Besides offering essays on subjects that have received a lack of critical attention, the essays presented here are truly interdisciplinary; they explore the complex links between gynaecology, art, language, and philosophy, and underscore how popular art forms have served an important function in the formation of \x91women\x92s science\x92 prior to the twenty-first century. This book also demonstrates how a number of high-profile controversies were taken up and reworked by novelists, philosophers, and historians. Focusing on the vexed and convoluted story of women\x92s medicine, this volume offers new ways of thinking about gender, science, and the Western imagination.']",,,,left_only

The protocol standardization and the reduction in instrumental rehabilitation mean that even though some individual tailoring is required, it will be possible to plan cost-effective rehabilitation within both the institutional and the private practice setting. The presented protocols cover vertigo in a wide range of conditions, including acute and chronic vestibular loss, vestibular ataxia, benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, Ménière’s disease, dizziness in the elderly, whiplash-associated balance disorders, phobic postural vertigo, and autonomic vertigo. Helpful information is provided on clinical approach to vertigo and dizziness and on vestibular rehabilitation from Cawthorne-Cooksey onward. The quantification of rehabilitation outcome and the role of life-style counseling are also discussed.

As a landscape this floodplain entity evolves and sets a niche to distinctive natural and cultural aspects. The historical reconstruction of the landscape transformation depicts the excessive human encroachment and development activities which leads to more than fifty percent of landscape transformation. Data set layers were generated in a geospatial environment, with the use of multiscale and multitemporal satellite imageries, empirical field verification, and ancillary data input. An integrated landscape model was hence formed in order to identify the causal links between natural and cultural aspects. The author shows a landscape transformation matrix and change detection maps to explain the spatial trends and patterns of land use and land cover change. Pixel wise land use and land cover gain-loss algorithm were identified and measured for a selected time period. Changing spatial pattern of land cover to land use ratio are explained with underlying local to regional level causes. The author thoroughly explains the satellite image interpretation and related methodology. This book provides the detailed transition journey of landscape conversion from resource rich natural entity to a human dominated ‘hazardscape’. It also explains how the expansion of population and related activities in the close vicinity of an active floodplain accentuates the problem of flood risks and how it affects the human and livestock life and creates economic loss. The author maps and explains the vector and magnitude of increased human pressure on the landscape and its adverse ecological implications, and describes issues with reference to the hazard status of the Punjab Satluj floodplain, including increased flood risk, increased pressure on agricultural land and depletion of resources, loss of biodiversity, qualitative and quantitative loss to surface and sub-surface water, and soil degradation (soil erosion, waterlogging and soil loss). Recommendations are provided with a detailed provision of potential applications with the underlying agenda of further conversion of this ecologically highly vulnerable flood prone ‘hazardscape’ to a Green Habitat. This book consist of two major themes: land use/land cover change and floodplain. The author answers all the geographical questions (what, where, when, why and how) related with both themes and provides an outlook to potential future prospects. The book is targeted at stakeholders, students, researchers and policy makers to optimize their interest and to guide them towards a positive charge in sustainable resource management through suitable and best possible sustainable utilization of landscape.']",,,,left_only

It shows the new ways of thinking about religion that emerged during the 17th and 18th centuries and have had a great impact on how we address problems related to religion in the public sphere today. Based on the assumption that political concepts are rooted in historical realities, this collection combines the perspective of political philosophy with the perspective of the history of ideas. Does secularism imply that individuals are not free to manifest their beliefs in public? Is secularization the same as rejecting faith in the absolute? Can there be a universal rational core in every religion? Does freedom of expression always go hand in hand with freedom of conscience? Is secularism an invention of the predominantly Christian West, which cannot be applied in other contexts, specifically that of Muslim cultures? Answers to these and related questions are sought not only in current theories and debates in political philosophy, but also in the writings of Immanuel Kant, Benedict Spinoza, Thomas Hobbes, Anthony Collins, Adriaan Koerbagh, Abbé Claude Yvon, Giovanni Paolo Marana, and others. \xa0.']",,,,left_only

Bridging institutional and cultural history, the book brings together a variety of elements of socialism as enacted by planners on a competitive urban stage, such as scientific debate, the crafting of symbolic landscapes, and state campaigns for the development of cultured cities and people.

For example, high and low temperature, acidic and alkaline conditions, high salt areas, high pressure, toxic compounds, high level of ionizing radiation, anoxia and absence of light, etc. Many organisms inhabit environments characterized by more than one form of stress (Polyextremophiles). Among them are those who live in hypersaline and alkaline, hot and acidic, cold/hot and high hydrostatic pressure, etc. Polyextremophiles found in desert regions have to cope with intense UV irradiation and desiccation, high as well as low temperatures, and low availability of water and nutrients. The chapters of this book provide an updated picture of our current understanding of the distribution of polyextremophilic microorganisms in nature and about the special physiological and biochemical properties that enable them to withstand multiple environmental extremes. It provides descriptions of unusual and less explored ecosystems such as Earth's cryosphere, marine hypersaline deeps, hot and cold desert environments, hot springs with elevated temperature and low or high pH. This book provides novel results of application to polyextremophiles research ranging from nanotechnology to synthetic biology to the origin of life and beyond. The topics of this volume are of importance not only for the understanding of the limits of life on Earth, but also for Astrobiology with the exploration of the possibility of life ‘as we know it’ to be present on other extraterrestrial bodies in the Universe.""]",,,,left_only

Among these, abiotic stress is the most detrimental; one that is responsible for nearly 50% of crop yield reduction and appears to be a potential threat to global food security in coming decades. Plant growth and development reduces drastically due to adverse effects of abiotic stresses. It has been estimated that crop can exhibit only 30% of their genetic potentiality under abiotic stress condition. So, this is a fundamental need to understand the stress responses to facilitate breeders to develop stress resistant and stress tolerant cultivars along with good management practices to withstand abiotic stresses. Also, a holistic approach to understanding the molecular and biochemical interactions of plants is important to implement the knowledge of resistance mechanisms under abiotic stresses. Agronomic practices like selecting cultivars that is tolerant to wide range of climatic condition, planting date, irrigation scheduling, fertilizer management could be some of the effective short-term adaptive tools to fight against abiotic stresses. In addition, “system biology” and “omics approaches” in recent studies offer a long-term opportunity at the molecular level in dealing with abiotic stresses. The genetic approach, for example, selection and identification of major conditioning genes by linkage mapping and quantitative trait loci (QTL), production of mutant genes and transgenic introduction of novel genes, has imparted some tolerant characteristics in crop varieties from their wild ancestors. Recently research has revealed the interactions between micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and plant stress responses exposed to salinity, freezing stress and dehydration. Accordingly transgenic approaches to generate stress-tolerant plant are one of the most interesting researches to date. This book presents the recent development of agronomic and molecular approaches in conferring plant abiotic stress tolerance in an organized way. The present volume will be of great interest among research students and teaching community, and can also be used as reference material by professional researchers.']",,,,left_only

It addresses the questions: How useful are L2 writing courses for the students who are required to take them? What do the students carry with them from these courses to their other disciplinary courses across the curriculum? What happens to these students after they leave ESL, English, or writing classes? Drawing on data from a 5-year longitudinal study of four university students for whom English was not their strongest/primary language, it captures their literacy experiences throughout their undergraduate careers. The intensive case studies answer some questions and raise others about these students' academic development as it entwined with their social experiences and identity formation and with the ideological context of studying at a U.S. university in the 1990s.--Cover, p.

It lays out a Nordic, or continental European teaching and learning paradigm whose didactic framework is distinct from the Anglo-American system. This analysis, which features contributions and case studies from researchers in a range of subjects, is built on principles such as the learner’s perspective, establishing sufficient intersubjectivity, ‘pointing out’, and informing experience linguistically. After clarifying some historical background, the book discusses the contemporary emphasis in early childhood education on pedagogy/learning. What should ‘didactics’ mean in educating young children? The book examines the opportunities for learning that teachers provide for children in early childhood education, as well as how children respond to these opportunities. It presents empirical studies from a variety of naturalistic settings, including mathematics, making visual art, ecology, music, dance, literacy and story-telling, as well as learning about gender, morality and democracy. The authors seek to answer key questions about the processes involved in both teaching and learning. What challenges do teachers face as they try to expand children’s knowledge in various fields of learning? How do they respond to these challenges, and what can we learn about children’s corresponding uptake? What now requires further research? One key distinction in researching children’s learning is between studies that look at ‘process’ and those that analyze ‘product’. In the tradition of Piaget, Vygotsky and Werner, as well as Mercer and Valsiner’s more recent work, this book advocates the importance and relative rareness of the former type of study.']",,,,left_only

The editors offer us a framework for educational research of Five Rs - remembering, regression, reconceptualization, refraction, and renewal - but ask us also to look for instances of resistance (their italics). \\'— John Galloway on the Mirandanet network \\'This material is valuable. . . especially for academics and dedicated higher education students. \\'— Personalized Education Now Following the financial crises in 2007, we have seen the intensification of neoliberal policies in education, with radical and potentially irrevocable shifts in the educational landscape, promoted under the auspices of ‘austerity’. This book highlights the central features of neoliberal education policies, their origins, recent developments and also their inherent weaknesses and flaws. It provides insights into the day to day realities and negative impacts of recent policies on the professional practice and work of educators, demonstrating how the changing conditions have led to de-professionalisation, alienation and a loss of professional autonomy and identity. The book also provides a set of accounts that detail the new realities emerging as a result of ‘austerity’ policies and questions the degree to which austerity has actually been developed as an ideological ‘cover story’ for the further monetisation and privatisation of public services. The various chapters challenge the common assumption that the neoliberal project is a monolithic orthodoxy by highlighting its complexities, variations and contradictions in the ways policies are refracted through action and practice in different contexts. The book also challenges the common assumption that there are no viable alternatives to neoliberal education policies, and does so by presenting a range of different examples, theoretical perspectives, discourses and alternative practices. It is argued that such alternatives not only highlight the range of different approaches, choices and possibilities but also provide the seedbed for a reimagined educational future. The authors offer a range of conceptual and theoretical insights and analyses that highlight the weaknesses and limitations inherent within the neoliberal education project and also illustrate the dangers in following the prevailing hegemonic discourse and trajectories. It is postulated that alternative educational approaches warrant greater and urgent attention because history suggests that rather than having weathered the recent economic crisis, we may well be witnessing the long tail of decline for the neoliberal project. This book will be useful for educators, researchers, students and policy makers interested in the detrimental effects of neoliberal education, the range of viable alternatives, and the routes to resistance and ways of reimagining alternative educational futures."", 'Includes bibliographies and index']",,,,left_only

The periodical Yearbook of Morphology, published since 1988, has proven to be an eminent support for this upswing of morphological research, and has shown that morphology is central to present-day linguistic theorizing. In the Yearbook of Morphology 2005 a number of important theoretical issues are discussed: the role of inflectional paradigms in morphological analysis, the differences between words and affixes, and the adequacy of competing models of word structure. In addition, the role of phonological factors in shaping complex words is discussed. Evidence for particular positions defended in this volume is taken from a wide variety of languages. This volume is of interest to those working in theoretical, descriptive and historical linguistics, morphologists, phonologists, computational linguists, and psycholinguists. Beginning with Volume 16 (2006) the Yearbook of Morphology continues as a journal with the title: Morphology. This is the only journal entirely devoted to the study of linguistic morphology.

Originally conceived as part of algebraic topology, this essential concept and its analogies have found numerous applications in mathematics that are still being investigated today, and which are explored in this volume, the result of a meeting at Heidelberg University that brought together mathematicians who use or study fundamental groups in their work with an eye towards applications in arithmetic. The book acknowledges the varied incarnations of the fundamental group: pro-finite, ℓ-adic, p-adic, \xa0pro-algebraic and motivic. It explores a wealth of topics that range from anabelian geometry (in particular the section conjecture), the ℓ-adic polylogarithm, gonality questions of modular curves, vector bundles in connection with monodromy, and relative pro-algebraic completions, to a motivic version of Minhyong Kim's non-abelian Chabauty method and p-adic integration after Coleman. The editor has also included the abstracts of all the talks given at the Heidelberg meeting, as well as the notes on Coleman integration and on Grothendieck's fundamental group with a view towards anabelian geometry taken from a series of introductory lectures given by Amnon Besser and Tamás Szamuely, respectively.""]",,,,left_only

Reflecting his experience as scholar, teacher, and perennial learner, the author suggests how research in phenomenology might prove beneficial to the enhancement of both the theoretical and practical aspects of education; readers are invited to envision education as far more than merely a means by which to organize an effective learning experience in which knowledge is assimilated and skill sets are efficiently imparted, but rather as a holistic and integrated process in which knowing, acting, and valuing are original ways of Being-in-the-world""--']",,,,left_only

In this pioneering volume, experts on individual and collective trauma experience, posttraumatic stress and related syndromes, and emergency and crisis intervention – share knowledge and insights on the cultural context of working with ethnic and racial minority communities during disasters. In each chapter, emotional, psychological, and social needs as well as communal strengths and coping skills that arise in disasters are documented for major minority groups in the United States including specific chapters on African Americans, Native Americans, Arab Americans, Asian Indians, Chinese Americans, Caribbean Americans, Latin Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Vietnamese Americans. Each chapter features information on: Demographics, major historical events, and core values of each population Important cultural insights, including communication styles, culture-specific disorders, and valid assessment instruments Therapeutic and healing traditions versus conventional medicine and therapy Perspectives specific to the population’s experience with disaster and trauma Authors’ recommendations for improving services to the population Practical appendices for readers new to the field This unique volume is a cultural competency compendium that will increase to the effectiveness of all who respond to disasters. It will also be of interest and value to scholars, policy makers, and health professionals working in the areas of disaster management, crisis intervention, and trauma.

Along the way, the investigation takes on thorny lexical issues – reformulating the Theta Criterion, revisiting the multiple lexical-entry debate, eliminating ""indirect"" arguments and redefining unaccusativity. It offers new insights into how arguments are represented, assembles a host of argument/adjunct diagnostics, and re-examines the relation between arguments and predicates. The result of this incisive study is a simple and consistent account of linking, integrated with a radical rethinking of the nature of arguments and argument structure. From the reviews: ""Janet Randall’s Linking: The Geometry of Argument Structure, is an authoritative journey through a minefield of critical problems. Arguing a symmetry between conceptual structure and argument structure, it will richly reward those readers who do themselves the favor of taking the trip."" (Samuel Jay Keyser, Professor Emeritus, MIT) ""In this book, Janet Randall, building on much recent research, develops her own version of a geometrical theory of the lexicon and explores a restrictive hypothesis on how lexical entries project into syntactic structure, based on structure preservation. Even those who, like myself, are not so inclined to think of word meaning in geometric terms, will find in this book a striking series of puzzles, challenges, and insights."" (Gennaro Chierchia, Haas Foundations Professor of Linguistics, Harvard University) ""Janet Randall\'s book is a model of how to reason across the interface between conceptual structure and syntax. It is a goldmine of razor sharp observations about argument structure and morphology. Each theoretical step is supported by carefully developed empirical evidence. It will be a lasting accomplishment at both the theoretical and empirical level."" (Tom Roeper, University of Massachusetts, Amherst).']",,,,left_only

Trans-racial? Post-racial? And what—if anything—should this mean to professionals in clinical practice with diverse clients? The ambitious volume The Concept of Race and Psychotherapy probes these questions, compelling readers to look differently at their clients (and themselves), and offering a practical framework for more effective therapy. By tracing the racial “folk taxonomies” of eight cultures in the Americas and the Caribbean, the author elegantly defines race as a fluid construct, dependent on local social, political, and historical context for meaning but meaningless in the face of science. This innovative perspective informs the rest of the book, which addresses commonly held assumptions about problem behavior and the desire to change, and presents a social-science-based therapy model, applicable to a wide range of current approaches, that emphasizes both cultural patterns and client uniqueness. Among the highlights of the coverage: Common elements in therapy and healing across cultures. The psychological appeal of racial concepts despite scientific evidence to the contrary. Lessons psychology can learn from anthropology. Three types of therapeutic relationships, with strategies for working effectively in each. The phenomenon of discontinuous change in brief therapy. Solution-focused therapy from a cross-cultural perspective. Thought-provoking reading for psychologists, psychiatrists, clinical social workers, and other mental health professionals as well as graduate students in these fields, The Concept of Race and Psychotherapy affirms the individuality—and the interconnectedness—of every client.']",,,,left_only

How can we create societies that are more equal in terms of income distribution, gender equality and opportunities? How can we remedy the social divide that is making Latin America one of the most unequal regions on earth? What are the roles played by market forces, institutions and ideology in terms of inequality? In this book, a group of global experts gathered by the Institute for the Integration of Latin America and the Caribbean (INTAL), part of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), show readers how various types of inequality, such as economical, educational, racial and gender inequality have been practiced in countries like Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico and many others through the centuries. Presenting new ideas, new evidence, and new methods, the book subsequently analyzes how to move forward with second-generation reforms that lay the foundations for more egalitarian societies. As such, it offers a valuable and insightful guide for development economists, historians and Latin American specialists alike, as well as students, educators, policymakers and all citizens with an interest in development, inequality and the Latin American region.']",,,,left_only

Drawing from a range of disciplines, Jill Marshall examines how human rights law includes and excludes specific types of identity, which feed into moral norms of human freedom and human dignity and their translation into legal rights. The book takes on a three part structure. Part I traces the definition of identity, and follows the evolution of a right to personal identity and personality within human rights law. It specifically examines the development of a right to personal identity as property, the inter-subjective nature of identity, and the intercession of power and inequality. Part II evaluates past and contemporary attempts to describe the core of personal identity, including theories concerning the soul, the rational mind, and the growing influence of neuroscience and genetics in distinguishing the human. It also explores the inter-relation and conflict between universal principles and culturally specific rights. Part III focuses on issues and case law that can be interpreted as allowing self-determination. Marshall argues that while in an age of individual identity, people are increasingly obliged to live in conformed ways, pushing out identities that do not fit with what is acceptable. Drawing on feminist theory, the book concludes by arguing how human rights law would be better interpreted as a force to enable respect for human dignity and freedom of self-determination. In drawing on socio-legal, philosophical, biological and feminist outlooks, this book is truly interdisciplinary, and will be of great interest and use to scholars and students of human rights law, legal and social theory, and gender studies""--']",,,,left_only

In addition to the dynamics of movement, the book provides an in-depth analysis of the heterogeneity of this emigration. It deepens the multifaceted identities concerning social and professional pathways among highly skilled and less skilled emigrants. The labour market continues to be the main regulatory force of Portuguese emigration, which helps to explain the outflow and the processes of settlement and return.

Of great interest to Victorians, this subject often appears in neo-Victorian novels including those by such well-known authors as John Fowles, A. S. Byatt, Graham Swift, and Mathew Kneale. This book discusses novels in which nineteenth-century science, including geology, paleontology, and evolutionary theory, interacts with religion through accommodations, conflicts, and crises of faith. In general, these texts abandon conventional religion but retain the ethical connectedness and celebration of life associated with spirituality at its best. Registering the growth of nineteenth-century secularism and drawing on aspects of the romantic tradition and ecological thinking, they honor the natural world without imagining that it exists for humans or functions in reference to human values. In particular, they enact a form of wonderment: the capacity of the mind to make sense of, creatively adapt, and enjoy the world out of which it has evolved -- in short, to endow it with meaning. Protagonists who come to experience reality in this expansive way release themselves from self-anxiety and alienation. In this book, Glendening shows how, by intermixing past and present, fact and fiction, neo-Victorian narratives, with a few instructive exceptions, manifest this pattern.""--Publisher\'s website.']",,,,left_only

Heim presents a robust argument in favor of the Cowles model as an answer to the pressing, unresolved methodological question of how to accurately model the macroeconomy so that policymakers can reliably use these models to assist their decision making. Thirty-eight behavioral equations, describing determinants of variables such as consumption, taxes, and government spending, are connected by eighteen identities to construct a comprehensive model of the real US economy that Heim then tests across four different time periods to ensure that results are consistent. This comprehensive demonstration of the value of a long-ignored model provides overwhelming evidence that the more Keynesian (Cowles) structural models outperform VAR and DSGE, and therefore should be the models of choice in future macroeconomic studies. .']",,,,left_only

Do we need new methods for African philosophy and studies? Or, are the methods of Western thought adequate for African intellectual space? These questions are not some of the easiest to answer because they lead straight to the question of whether or not a logic tradition from African intellectual space is possible. Thus in charting the course of future direction in African philosophy and studies, one must be confronted with this question of logic. The author boldly takes up this challenge and becomes the first to do so in a book by introducing new concepts and formulating a new African culture-inspired system of logic called Ezumezu which he believes would ground new methods in African philosophy and studies. He develops this system to rescue African philosophy and, by extension, sundry fields in African Indigenous Knowledge Systems from the spell of Plato and the hegemony of Aristotle. African philosophers can now ground their discourses in Ezumezu logic which will distinguish their philosophy as a tradition in its own right. On the whole, the book engages with some of the lingering controversies in the idea of (an) African logic before unveiling Ezumezu as a philosophy of logic, methodology and formal system. The book also provides fresh arguments and insights on the themes of decolonisation and Africanisation for the intellectual transformation of scholarship in Africa. It will appeal to philosophers and logicians—undergraduates and post graduate researchers—as well as those in various areas of African studies.']",,,,left_only

The main theme in this book is to teach modeling based on the principle that the objective is to extract the information from data that can be learned with suggested classes of probability models. The intuitive and fundamental concepts of complexity, learnable information, and noise are formalized, which provides a firm information theoretic foundation for statistical modeling. Inspired by Kolmogorov\'s structure function in the algorithmic theory of complexity, this is accomplished by finding the shortest code length, called the stochastic complexity, with which the data can be encoded when advantage is taken of the models in a suggested class, which amounts to the MDL (Minimum Description Length) principle. The complexity, in turn, breaks up into the shortest code length for the optimal model in a set of models that can be optimally distinguished from the given data and the rest, which defines ""noise"" as the incompressible part in the data without useful information. Such a view of the modeling problem permits a unified treatment of any type of parameters, their number, and even their structure. Since only optimally distinguished models are worthy of testing, we get a logically sound and straightforward treatment of hypothesis testing, in which for the first time the confidence in the test result can be assessed. Although the prerequisites include only basic probability calculus and statistics, a moderate level of mathematical proficiency would be beneficial. The different and logically unassailable view of statistical modelling should provide excellent grounds for further research and suggest topics for graduate students in all fields of modern engineering, including and not restricted to signal and image processing, bioinformatics, pattern recognition, and machine learning to mention just a few. The author is an Honorary Doctor and Professor Emeritus of the Technical University of Tampere, Finland, a Fellow of Helsinki Institute for Information Technology, and visiting Professor in the Computer Learning Research Center of University of London, Holloway, England. He is also a Foreign Member of Finland\'s Academy of Science and Letters, an Associate Editor of IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information and of EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology. He is also a former Associate Editor of Source Coding of IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. The author is the recipient of the IEEE Information Theory Society\'s 1993 Richard W.

Across eight chapters this volume explores the regions’ thorny relationship with their complex histories of colonialism and slavery as well as the ongoing, multifaceted constructions of hegemonic and counter-hegemonic identities at the individual, regional and national levels. In doing so, it demonstrates the unique and rich particularities of these regions and why it is that they challenge many conventional dogmas and methods across the Social Sciences.

During the last decade, 3DE has made a dramatic transition from a predominantly research tool used in few large academic medical centers to a technology available in most echocardiography laboratories, cardiac surgery operating rooms and catheterization and/or electrophysiology labs to address everyday clinical practice and guide interventional procedures. 3DE is now an established technique able to provide intuitive recognition of cardiac structures from any spatial point of view and complete information about absolute heart chamber volumes and function. In particular, 3DE has demonstrated its superiority over current echocardiographic modalities in a number of clinical applications. The Textbook of Real-Time Three Dimensional Echocardiography is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the normal anatomy of the heart as seen by this new revolutionary ultrasound technique, and focusing on the clinical value of transthoracic 3DE and on the expanding role of transesophageal 3DE in guiding and monitoring surgical and interventional procedures. For echocardiographers who already use 3DE, the more advanced applications of 3DE are presented in detail. For those looking to learn 3DE, the Editors and their contributors have provided hundreds of images and videos in an that show the added clinical value of 3D imaging of cardiac structures. This textbook is therefore written not only for cardiologists specifically involved in the imaging of patients but also for general cardiologists, since it offers a wider clinical view of normal and pathological cardiac anatomy.']",,,,left_only

Providing a historical and theoretical framework for practitioners and scholars in evaluating the politics of modern American school design, the book holds a mirror to the oft-criticized state of American education today.']",,,,left_only

Garroway offers a revised account of the origin of the all-important Christian word “gospel,” yielding significant new insights into the development of early Christian history and literature. Long thought to have originated on the lips of Jesus or his disciples, “gospel” was in fact coined by Paul midway through his career to describe his controversial new interpretation of Jesus’ death and resurrection. For nearly a decade after the crucifixion, the thoroughly Jewish Jesus movement demanded circumcision and Law observance from Gentile converts. Only in the early 40s did Paul arrive at the belief that such observance was no longer necessary, an insight he dubbed “the gospel,” or good news. The remainder of Paul’s career featured clashes with authorities over the legitimacy of the gospel, debates that continued after his death in the writings of Mark, Matthew, and Luke-Acts. These writings obscured the original context of the gospel, however, and in time the word lost its specific association with Paul and his scandalous notion of salvation outside the Law. .']",,,,left_only

The contributors have different attitudes and agendas. Some are ecologists, some planners, others social scientists. Focus ranges from identification of threats and amelioration of damaging effects through to future design of transport systems to minimize environmental degradation. Some chapters consider restricted areas of the globe; others the globe itself. Views encompass deep pessimism and cautious optimism. Uniquely, the volume considers transport effects in all environments. This is the first book that attempts to discuss the relationship between human transport and all ecosystems. It appeals not only to the specialist environmentalist by picking out novel topics, but also to anyone involved in transport issues as it tackles the issues from an historical perspective, encompassing the past, present and future of the effects of human transport.']",,,,left_only

The author points out some of the contradictions that emerge in contemporary rights language when material relations are not sufficiently perceived or acknowledged, and he directs attention to the role of some rights talk in maintaining and managing the accelerated global project of capital accumulation. Even as rights discourse points to injustices—for example, injustices related to labor, gender, the citizen’s relationship to the state, or the movement of refugees—it can simultaneously maintain systems of oppression. By constructing subjects who are aligned to the interests of capital, by emphasizing individual “empowerment,” and/or by containing social disenchantment, it reinforces the process of wealth accumulation, supports neoliberal ideologies, and diminishes the possibility of real transformation through collective struggle.

Unfortunately, many believe that common sense is a trait you are either born with or you are not. This book dispels that myth. Through the pages of Common Sense: Get It, Use It, and Teach It\xa0in the Workplace readers will learn not only what common sense is, but how to acquire it and use it to enhance their careers, increase their confidence, and take better advantage of business opportunities.\xa0 Common Sense explores the use—and non-use—of common sense in the workplace and the world around us. It shows how you can become a person of great wisdom and good judgment by simply learning about all the ways people stumble in the thought process. Author Ken Tanner, a seasoned manager, consultant, and former regional vice president for two major U.S. restaurant chains, shows readers how to make better decisions, how to spot and avoid fallacious thinking, how to better assess ambiguous situations, and how to become a mature thinker with a knack for making the right move at just the right time.\xa0\xa0 Best of all, Common Sense shows how to teach this trait to others, especially subordinates and co-workers who can and will do\xa0nonsensical things unless you help them learn to reason through their decisions and actions quickly and confidently. The payoff? Your staff will make you look good, greasing the way for greater responsibility and opportunity. This book: Takes you through an understanding of the term ""common sense""—what it means and what it doesn’t mean. Shows how fallacies create barriers to using common sense. Provides dozens of examples of the application (as well as rejection) of common sense in the business world and elsewhere. Shows how to teach common sense to others.']",,,,left_only

In the face of what has persisted as a highly charged political issue over cow protection in India, intellectual space must be made to bring the wealth of Indian traditional ethical discourse to bear on the realities of current human-animal relationships, particularly those of humans with cows. Dharma, yoga, and bhakti paradigms serve as starting points for bringing Hindu—particularly Vaishnava Hindu—animal ethics into conversation with contemporary Western animal ethics. The author argues that a culture of bhakti—the inclusive, empathetic practice of spirituality centered in Krishna as the beloved cowherd of Vraja—can complement recently developed ethics-of-care thinking to create a solid basis for sustaining all kinds of cow care communities. ; Offers a focused insight into a key aspect of Hindu religious practice Integrates primary research and tertiary sources to give a multifaceted understanding of the intricacies of cow care practice Challenges conventional Western thought on cow care and its worldwide implications for animal ethics ']",,,,left_only

Whilst omnipresent in the context of bioethics, this book reveals its wider use in healthcare more generally, treatment of prisoners, education, employment, and matters of life and death in many countries. In this unique comparative work, contributing authors share a multidisciplinary analysis of the use (and potential misuse) of the principle of dignity in Europe, Africa, South and North America and Asia. By revealing the ambivalence of human dignity in a wide range of cultures and contexts and through the evolving reality of case law, this book is a valuable resource for students, scholars and professionals working in bioethics, medicine, social sciences and law. Ultimately, it will make all those who invoke the principle of human dignity more aware of its multi-layered character and force us all to reflect on its ability to further social justice within our societies.']",,,,left_only

In brief, participatory video refers to participant-centered video making. Today, participant-generated videos can travel farther and faster than ever before, and thus, the perspectives represented can be effectively shared by a large number of people. Participatory video can also offer those involved an opportunity to address issues that matter to them and give voice to their experiences. The author explores this potential based on her experience working with adult learners in a metropolitan community and addresses participatory video in both theory and practice. The target readership is adult educators, but it will also be helpful to researchers who have a particular interest in incorporating video into their community-based work.']",,,,left_only

Based on empirical results from interviews, it is analyzed how citizenship is emplaced through ego-centered networks and assemblages that situate the migrants’ social belonging; how it is embodied through carving out of identities of the migrant workers, intersectionality of gender, ethnicity, and class, affects that imprint workers’ bodies, and experiences of violence at the workplace; then citizenships’ enactment is scrutinized through workers’ empowerment for rights, individually at the workplace and collectively through demonstrations and political theater performance in urban public space.

The author draws on cases from Canada, France and the United Kingdom, exploring: minority women and debates over culture and religion; riots and young men in France and England; citizen journalism and the creative use of different media; and solidarity between migrant justice and indigenous activists. Analysis across these diverse settings considers whether and how a politics of listening, which demands that the roles of speakers and listeners change, can be undertaken in adversarial and tense political moments. The Politics of Listening argues that such a practice has the potential to create new ways of being and acting together, as political equals who are heard on their own terms. The book will appeal to students and scholars across a range of disciplines, including sociology and political theory.']",,,,left_only

The book highlights the determinants of long term growth, the role of innovations and entrepreneurs as well as the interplay between different sectors of the economy over major epochs. The epochal shifts are presented in a long wave pattern with global crises as decisive turnings points. The theoretical approach is integrated into a broad description of the historical evolution from the agricultural society over industrialization up to the present service and IT-oriented society. The book is based on a rich and detailed quantitative material from research over the past decades with consecutive time series over production volumes, employment, productivity, investments etc. for sectors and branches covering the whole economy, even including estimates of non-marketed domestic work. It is also based on a broad literature from Swedish historiography with details on the individual level of firms, innovators and entrepreneurs. Focus is upon the interplay between technological, economic and social change where a number of broad themes are treated with a general interest to historians or economists, e.g. the role of social change and domestic markets versus international specialisation and exports as dynamic factors in Swedish economic growth. Epochs with different structures appears as long waves, demarcated by international or global crises around 1850, 1890, 1930, 1975 and apparently once again around 2010. A particular perspective is upon radical innovations that form expansive development blocks and create a basis for international specialisation within each epoch""--']",,,,left_only

The author analyzes equivalence relations for these functions and develops several new methods for construction of their infinite families. In addition, the book offers solutions to two longstanding open problems, including the problem on characterization of APN and AB functions via Boolean, and the problem on the relation between two classes of bent functions.']",,,,left_only

Twenty-five years ago a book of this nature would have been largely written by non-Indigenous researchers about Indigenous people and education. Today Indigenous researchers can write this work about and for themselves and others. The book is comprehensive in its coverage. Authors are drawn from various individual jurisdictions that have significant indigenous populations where the issues include language, culture and identity, and indigenous people’s participation in society. It brings together multiple streams of research by ‘new’ indigenous voices. The book also brings together a wide range of educational topics including early childhood education, educational governance, teacher education, curriculum, pedagogy, educational psychology, etc. The focus of one body of work on Indigenous education is a welcome enhancement to the pursuit of the field of Indigenous educational aspirations and development.']",,,,left_only

The work demonstrates that Polish homosexual activists were not locked behind the Iron Curtain, but actively participated in the transnational construction of homosexuality. Their magazines were largely influenced by Western magazines: used similar words, discussed similar topics or simply translated Western texts and reproduced Western images. However, the imported ideas were not just copied but selectively adopted as well as strategically and creatively adapted in the Polish magazines so their authors could construct their own unique identities and build their own original politics.']",,,,left_only

Contributors describe their selection and use of historical, literary, and artistic content in teaching cross-cultural encounters, and provide strategies for overcoming the practical and conceptual challenges this material presents. Collectively traversing disciplinary, periodic, geographic, and linguistic boundaries, essays address topics ranging from the intersections of race, religion, gender, and nation in cross-cultural encounters to the use of popular culture and new media as pedagogical tools. Crucially, contributors reflect on how medieval and early modern cross-cultural encounters travel through time, accrue new meanings, and continue to shape our actions and thoughts today""--']",,,,left_only

Economists’ ideas about power are examined from political, theoretical and policy-making points of view, with additional discussion of the active participation of economists in the management of power. The book is organized into four main conceptions of power relations: i) Power as embedded in political institutions; ii) Power as emerging from the asymmetric relations caused by the unequal distribution of income and wealth; iii) Power as associated to the monopolistic or oligopolistic position held by some firms in the market; and iv) Power as the management of economic policies by the state. Mosca brings together contributions from a range of scholars to analyse how economists have considered the role of power, putting the discussion into a much needed historical context. Manuela Mosca is Professor of History of Economic Thought in the Department of Economics, University of Salento, Italy and Visiting Professor at the University of Bologna, Italy.

Starting with the central yet elusive concept of stewardship, it then expands upon the core components of MBI pedagogy. A series of reflective essays by MBI teachers from around the world foregrounds differences and challenges in meeting participants “where they are.” Such reflections are both inspiring and thought-provoking for teachers —wherever they are. The book also provides practical guidance and tools for adjusting teaching style and content for special populations, from chronic pain patients to trauma survivors, from health care professionals to clergy, and including many others. Detailed scripts and practices, ready to adopt and adapt, offer opportunities to explore new directions in the classroom, and to continue the life-long development of the teacher. Included in the coverage: • Deepening teachers’ skills of guidance of meditation practices • Insights into the essential practice of inquiry and dialogue with participants • New practices that allow participants to explore mindfulness together in a spoken encounter • How to keep up with, review, and make clear to participants the range of scientific evidence supporting the MBIs The breadth of practical insights and hands-on strategies makes Resources for Teaching Mindfulness a unique developmental asset for a wide range of practitioners around the world. Among those who will benefit are physicians and other medical practitioners, health and clinical psychologists, marriage and family therapists, nurses, clinical social workers, physical and occupational therapists, health educators, and organizational development specialists. “A deep, supportive, and challenging dive into the art of teaching mindfulness, including the science of it, in the form of MBSR and other mindfulness-based interventions.

Many of the developments in modern technology are complex, risky, and, to begin with, cloaked in uncertainty. How should we deal with such developments – that may not only have positive effects (such as an increase of our well-being or an improved ability to control and cure diseases) but also negative effects for human beings and the environment (such as global warming or the medicalisation of human beings)? The fact that technological ‘progress’ often occurs under conditions of uncertainty makes the issue even more pressing. Frequently, we are completely devoid of information concerning the applications of new technologies and what their impact will be on human beings and the environment. History has shown that taking a retrospective perspective by passively awaiting the practical consequences of new technologies is both dangerous and inappropriate, as often damage will already have occurred. The genie is well and truly out of the bottle and those who once had control over the new processes no longer have that power, as the science will have a momentum of its own, unheeding of belated attempts to stop it or slow it down. What is more, technology is often ‘logically malleable’, with far wider applications than even we can anticipate. Thus, say editors Sollie and Düwell, an anticipatory attitude is required towards dealing with new technology. This book addresses methodological issues with regard to the ethical evaluation of new and emerging technology. It focuses specifically on the concept of uncertainty that, unlike the notion of risk, is greatly undervalued in the field of ethics. It is a must-read for anyone involved in (ethical) technology assessment: philosophers, those involved in science and technology studies, and policy-makers alike.']",,,,left_only

As the intersection between the two fields continues to grow worldwide, both in case law and in regulation, the book\'s markets-based approach, focusing on sectors such as pharmaceuticals, IT, telecoms, energy and agriculture in eleven of the world\'s most active jurisdictions, provides a much-needed in-depth understanding of how this interplay reveals itself among the different legal systems...[This] book provides an international comparative perspective as well as detailed analysis of specific cases, policies and proposals for change. Among the issues and topics covered are the following: free movement of goods and the protection of intellectual property rights; standard essential patents & injunction in patent cases; intellectual property rights between technological development and consumer protection; geo-blocking; online platforms and antitrust; and excessive prices. In this context, special attention is paid throughout to the increasing dialogue among competition authorities and between judges and competition authorities around the world. As matchless remedy for the lack of uniformity heretofore, the book\'s investigation of the nexus between competition law and intellectual property in different sectors and in various countries takes a giant step towards a more-balanced approach and more-levelled regulation and practices.""--']",,,,left_only

While these diseases appear to emerge from thin air, in fact, human activity is driving them. And the problem is not just flu, but a series of rapidly evolving and dangerous modern plagues. According to veterinarian and journalist Mark Walters, we are contributing to—if not overtly causing—some of the scariest epidemics of our time. Through human stories and cutting-edge science, Walters explores the origins of seven diseases: Mad Cow Disease, HIV/AIDS, Salmonella DT104, Lyme Disease, Hantavirus, West Nile, and new strains of flu. He shows that they originate from manipulation of the environment, from emitting carbon and clear-cutting forests to feeding naturally herbivorous cows “recycled animal protein.” Readers will both learn how today’s plagues first developed and discover patterns that could help prevent the diseases of tomorrow.']",,,,left_only

Investigating especially consumerism’s unconscious aspects such as desires, imagination, and fantasy, it engages with an extensive analysis of dreams. The author frames these using a synthesis of Jungian psychology and the social imaginaries of Baudrillard and Bauman, in a dialogue with the theories of McDonaldization and Disneyization. The aim is to broaden our understanding of consumerism to include the perennial consumption of symbols and signs of identity - a process which is the basis for the fabrication of the commodified self. The book offers a profound, innovative critique of our consumption societies, challenging readers to rethink how we live, and how our identities are impacted by consumerism. As such it will be of interest to students and scholars of critical psychology, psychoanalysis, sociology, anthropology and cultural studies, but is also accessible to anyone interested in the complex psychology of contemporary subjectivity.']",,,,left_only

Kenneth Wain, University of Malta Lifelong learning in later life is an essential handbook for a wide range of people who work alongside older adults in varied contexts. This handbook brings together both orthodox approaches to educational gerontology and fresh perspectives on important emerging issues faced by seniors around the globe. Issues discussed include the social construction of ageing, the importance of lifelong learning policy and practice, participation in later life learning, education of marginalised groups within older communities, inter-generational learning, volunteering and ‘active ageing’, the political economy of older adulthood, learning for better health and well-being, and the place of seniors in a learning society.

Amid calls for criminology and criminal justice institutions to respond more effectively to the injustices faced by LGBTIQ people, criminologists have recently developed a Queer Criminology and turned to queer scholarship in the process. Through a sweeping analysis of critical criminologies, as well as issues as varied as shame and utopian thought, Matthew Ball points to the many opportunities for criminology to engage further with the more politically disruptive strands of queer scholarship. His analysis highlights that criminology and queer theory are 'dangerous bedfellows', and that navigating the tension between them is central to confronting the social and criminal injustices experienced by LGBTIQ communities.

The tools of non-classical logic at Routley’s disposal enabled him to update Meinong’s project for a new generation.

While some poets engage their literary forebears to exorcise anxiety and others use Hell to sharpen their cultural critique, most recent poets, including James Merrill, Derek Walcott, Tony Harrison, and Seamus Heaney, have found the Underworld descent to be a useful framework for addressing the claims of history and politics.']",,,,left_only

Petri nets are one of the more promising mathematical tools for tackling deadlocks in various resource allocation systems. In a system modeled with Petri nets, siphons are tied to the occurrence of deadlock states as a structural object. The book systematically introduces the novel theory of siphons, traps, elementary and dependent siphons of Petri nets as well as the deadlock control strategies for FMS developed from it. Deadlock prevention methods are examined comparatively. Many FMS examples are presented to demonstrate the concepts and results of this book, ranging from the simple to the complex. Importantly, to inspire and motivate the reader’s interest in further research, a number of interesting and open problems in this area are proposed at the end of each chapter. Deadlock Resolution in Automated Manufacturing Systems is directed to control, computer, electrical, mechanical, and industrial engineers, researchers and scientists. It will be useful for designers in the automation and control disciplines in industry and academia who need to develop the control methods, tools and software to improve the performance of automated flexible manufacturing systems.']",,,,left_only

The book does so by identifying what makes excellent presenters such as Brian Cox, Jane Goodall, Richard Feynman, and Jill Bolte Taylor so strong. In addition, the book explains what causes so many scientific presentations to flounder. One of the most valuable contributions of this text is that it teaches the assertion-evidence approach to scientific presentations. Instead of building presentations, as most engineers and scientists do, on the weak foundation of topic phrases and bulleted lists, this assertion-evidence approach calls for building presentations on succinct message assertions supported by visual evidence. Unlike the commonly followed topic-subtopic approach that PowerPoint leads presenters to use, the assertion-evidence approach is solidly grounded in research. By showing the differences between strong and weak presentations, by identifying the errors that scientific presenters typically make, and by teaching a much more powerful approach for scientific presentations than what is commonly practiced, this book places you in a position to elevate your presentations to a high level. In essence, this book aims to have you not just succeed in your scientific presentations, but excel. About the Author Michael Alley has taught workshops on presentations to engineers and scientists on five continents, and has recently been invited to speak at the European Space Organization, Harvard Medical School, MIT, Sandia National Labs, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Simula Research Laboratory, and United Technologies.

In adopting an autoethnographic and life-history approach, Mike Hayler develops a theoretically informed discussion of how the professional identity of teacher educators is both formed and represented by narratives of experience. The book draws upon analytic autoethnography and life-history methods to explore the ways in which teacher educators construct and develop their conceptions and practice by engaging with memory through narrative, in order to negotiate some of the ambivalences and uncertainties of their work. The author’s own story of learning, embedded within the text, was shared with other teacher-educators, who following interviews wrote self-narratives around themes which emerged from discussion. The focus for analysis develops from how professional identity and pedagogy are influenced by changing perceptions and self-narratives of life and work experiences, and how this may influence professional culture, content and practice in this area. The book includes an evaluation of how using this approach has allowed the author to investigate both the subject and method of the research with implications for educational research and the practice of teacher education.

The author explores how the Japanese financial crisis of the late 1990s engendered huge restructuring efforts in the banking industry, which eventually led to even more sweeping changes of the economic system and long-term deflation in the 2000s. The discussion begins with an overview of the unconventional monetary policy launched by the Bank of Japan at this time, while banking administrative policies maintained their strict code of governance. The author describes how, just as recovery seemed possible, the twin disasters of the Lehman shock and the Great East Japan Earthquake buffeted the recovering economy, and pushed Japan again into deflation. The book also looks to the very recent past, with the sudden advent of Abenomics in 2013, with its three-pronged approach, which was intended to break the deflationary mindset. Finally, the author projects what the future of the banking industry in Japan might encompass, as looming demographic changes gradually threaten both the economy and the banking industry.']",,,,left_only

ICIAR will be organized annually, and will alternate between Europe and North America. ICIAR 2005 will take place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The idea of o?ering these conferences came as a result of discussion between researchers in Portugal and Canada to encourage collaboration and exchange, mainly between these two countries, but also with the open participation of other countries, addressing recent advances in theory, methodology and applications. The response to the call for papers for ICIAR 2004 was very positive. From 316 full papers submitted, 210 were accepted (97 oral presentations, and 113 - sters). The review process was carried out by the Program Committee members and other reviewers; all are experts in various image analysis and recognition areas. Each paper was reviewed by at least two reviewing parties. The high q- lity of the papers in these proceedings is attributed ?rst to the authors, and second to the quality of the reviews provided by the experts. We would like to thank the authors for responding to our call, and we wholeheartedly thank the reviewers for their excellent work in such a short amount of time. We are espe- ally indebted to the Program Committee for their e?orts that allowed us to set up this publication.

Focusing on the patients’ level of fulfilment and how it can be enhanced, it examines existing problems like waiting periods and overcrowding and how these can be alleviated to provide a better service. The author examined research papers from 1964 to 2018, and developed six research questions, organising them using mapping studies, the primary objectives of which were firstly, to obtain a common understanding of the problems that need to be highlighted in EDs, and secondly, to re-analyse the methods used. Focusing on quality, the book encourages citations of experimental methods from important studies concerning EDs that can improve services. Through different research papers, various thematic areas in the healthcare sector were examined, like the determination of the relative efficiency of pre-discharge interventions; the analysis of care and managing common indications during the last stages of life; using e-Health to enhance effectiveness and proficiency; the seriousness of patient differences among EDs; the identification of quality problems in healthcare contexts; existing opportunities and the suggested plans. The book concludes that an analytical decision-making process should be used to assess a health technology on the basis of its performance. It stresses the importance of updating this analytical system frequently.']",,,,left_only

After a century of research, the list of autoimmune diseases has become impressive. With a prevalence of approximately 5% of the world-wide population, these chronic, debilitating conditions affect almost every major organ of the body and, for reasons that remain unclear, are much more prevalent in woman than in men. Despite our rapidly expanding knowledge of the cellular and molecular pathways that govern a normal immune response, deciphering the precise etiology of autoimmune diseases remains an important challenge. Over the last few years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases has improved rapidly, leading to the emergence of elegant immunointervention strategies. Molecular Autoimmunity illustrates how cutting-edge research is continuing to advance our understanding of autoimmune disease mechanisms and identifies novel therapeutic targets that provide a hope for effective future treatments. This volume contains a selected number of exciting advances in unraveling autoimmune reactions, and the resulting new armory of experimental immunotherapies that may lead to new ways of controlling autoimmune reactions.']",,,,left_only

The authors in this book discuss education reform and science curriculum changes and promotion of science and STEM education, parental roles and involvement in children's education, teacher preparation and professional development and research in science education in the context of international benchmarking tests to measure the knowledge of mathematics and science such as the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and achievement in science, mathematics and reading like Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Among the high achieving countries, the performance of the students in East Asian countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and China (Shanghai) are notable. This book investigates the reasons why students from East Asian countries consistently claim the top places in each and every cycle of those study. It brings together prominent science educators and researchers from East Asia to share their experience and findings, reflection and vision on emerging trends, pedagogical innovations and research-informed practices in science education in the region. It provides insights into effective educational strategies and development of science education to international readers. This collection will be of great value to science educators in that region and to scholars in comparative education. It will also be illuminating to all those working in science education who are interested in teasing out the way cultural influences overlay and complement universal features of human cognition in determining how learners respond to science teaching. \xa0Keith Taber, Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge, UK The strong influence of culture on East Asian education is well-known. The\xa0 success of East Asian countries in international science achievement comparisons has recently achieved much accolade and the science education research community has been growing exponentially over the past few decades. Yet, few of us outside Asia, are well-versed in their approach to education. This volume is an excellent beginning.

The main focus lies on public control of armed forces and the question why civilians should have a vigilant eye on the military institution as well as the civilian authority that legitimizes the use of force. Based on the example of conscription and recruitment as an intersection between the military and society, this study engages in an analysis of institutional change in the politico-military field in post-Soviet Russia. Taking a critical stance on conventional military sociology, the book shifts the focus away from the exclusive power relationship between political and military elites in the context of national security. Instead, it takes into consideration human and societal security, i.e. the needs and demands of individuals and groups at the grassroots level, affected by the military and the prevailing security situation in Russia.

This is particularly true in the pediatric population, in which the neurosurgeon is faced with a wide variety of congenital developmental anomalies and acquired diseases and must take into account the need to avoid significant interference in still growing structures. Pediatric neurosurgeons are increasingly called upon to face this stimulating region, the diseases of which may now be managed with rewarding results even in the first years of life owing to progress in the neurosciences, availability of advanced neuroimaging diagnostic tools, and improved surgical and anesthesiological techniques. This dedicated volume in the series Advances and Technical Standards in Neurosurgery (ATSN) provides a comprehensive approach to CVJ diseases and their management based on the multidisciplinary cooperation of neurosurgeons, anatomists, neuroradiologists, and neuroanesthesiologists. The contributing authors represent the most renowned clinical and surgical experts from Europe and beyond. In accordance with the traditional structure of ATSN, the 12 chapters of the volume are organized into advanced (7) and standard (5) contributions. The main topics highlighted are embryology, normal and abnormal development of the CVJ, including the related vessels, modern radiological contributions to diagnosis, genetic and metabolic factors which may impact on the surgical strategies, the opportunities offered by traditional operative techniques, and the recently introduced minimally invasive and endoscopic surgical modalities. Special emphasis is also placed on the evolution of the principles of surgical treatment as matured during the past decade by experiences in the still open field of pediatric neurosurgery.']",,,,left_only

Final reflections tie these linguistic strategies and practices to wider issues of the ""self"" and ""agency"" in persons with dementia. Thematically, the volume fosters an integrated perspective on communication and cognition in terms of which communicative resources are recognized as cognitive resources, and communicative interaction is treated as reflecting cognitive engagement.

Personal-political examples are provided to illustrate some of the challenges but also opportunities facing activist scholars trying to resist neoliberalism. Heartfelt, frank, and unashamedly emotional, the book is a rallying cry for academics to defend their role as public intellectuals, to work together with communities, including those most negatively affected by neoliberalism and the corporatization of knowledge. .']",,,,left_only

Lennox corresponded with famous contemporaries from different walks of life such as James Boswell, David Garrick, Samuel Johnson, and Sir Joshua Reynolds, and she interacted with many other influential figures including her patroness the Countess of Bute, publisher Andrew Millar, and the Reverend Thomas Winstanley. In addition to Lennox\'s and her correspondents\' letters, this book presents related documents such as the author\'s proposals for subscription editions of her works, her file with the Royal Literary Fund, and a series of poems and stories supposedly composed by her son but perhaps written by herself. In these carefully and extensively annotated documents, Charlotte Lennox traces the vagaries in the career of a female writer in the male-dominated eighteenth-century literary marketplace. The introduction situates Lennox in the context of contemporaneous print culture and specifically examines the contentious question of the authorship of The Female Quixote, Lennox\'s experimentation with various forms of publication, and her appeals for charity to the Royal Literary Fund when she was impoverished towards the end of her life. The author who emerges from Charlotte Lennox was an active, assertive, innovative, and independent woman trying to find her place--and make a literary career--in eighteenth-century Britain. Thus, this volume makes an important contribution to the history of female authorship, literary history, and eighteenth-century studies.""--Publisher\'s website.']",,,,left_only

Oliver Pooth describes the silicon strip tracker of the CMS detector. With a sensitive silicon area of 200 m² it is a central part of the experiment and able to precisely measure charged particles originating from high energy proton collisions at the LHC. In total, more than 15,000 individual silicon strip detector modules were built and tested before they were integrated on larger substructures of the silicon strip tracker. The author discusses methods of quality control that are new to the field of particle detector physics. These methods were established to guarantee a uniform behaviour of all detector modules which were built and tested in various places worldwide. After integration into the CMS experiment and commissioning, the silicon strip tracker is now ready to operate for at least ten years of LHC running.']",,,,left_only

Combining industrial analysis of a major audiovisual field at a time of growth and change with close readings of significant texts on all screens, acclaimed author Paul Julian Smith deftly details these new audiovisual trends. The book includes perspectives on local reporting on the ground, as covered in the chapter documenting media response to the 2017 earthquake. And, for the first time in this field, the book draws throughout on star studies, tracing the distinct profiles of actors who migrate from one medium to another. As a whole, Smith’s analyses illustrate the key movements in screen media in one of the world’s largest media and cultural producing nations. These perspectives connect to and enrich scholarship across Latin American, North American, and global cases. Paul Julian Smith is Distinguished Professor in the Latin American, Iberian, and Latino Cultures Program at the Graduate Center in City University of New York, USA.

Medieval Romance is the first study to focus on the deep philosophical underpinnings of the genre\'s fictional worlds. James F. Knapp and Peggy A. Knapp uniquely utilize Leibniz\'s ""possible worlds"" theory, Kant\'s aesthetic reflections, and Gadamer\'s writings on the apprehension of language over time, to bring the romance genre into critical dialogue with fundamental questions of philosophical aesthetics, modal logic, and the hermeneutics of literary transmission. The authors\' compelling and illuminating analysis of six instances of medieval secular writing, including that of Marie de France, the Gawain-poet, and Chaucer demonstrates how the extravagantly imagined worlds of romance invite reflection about the nature of the real. These stories, which have delighted readers for hundreds of years, do so because the impossible fictions of one era prefigure desired realities for later generations.""--']",,,,left_only

According to this idea, a novel reasoning system is designed, which challenges all the dominating theories in how such a system should be built. The system carries out reasoning, learning, categorizing, planning, decision making, etc., as different facets of the same underlying process. This theory also provides unified solutions to many problems in AI, logic, psychology, and philosophy. This book is the most comprehensive description of this decades-long project, including its philosophical foundation, methodological consideration, conceptual design details, its implications in the related fields, as well as its similarities and differences to many related works in cognitive sciences.']",,,,left_only

All these reform efforts aim to restructure different aspects of schooling in order to promote learning and to prepare students for future challenges in globalised economies. These measures to a certain extent challenge traditional practices, established arrangements and deep-seated assumptions related to different aspects of learning. The authors in this book discuss educational reforms in different countries in the Asia-Pacific region in light of student learning, clarify their concepts, evaluate implementation and impact on the learning processes, with a hope that we can learn better from each other and develop a better understanding of ""contemporary"" learning and teaching processes within the region. The central argument running through different chapters in this book highlights the importance of understanding reforms and learning within their historical, political and sociocultural contexts. Reforming learning involves changes in established cultural practices in our schools, classrooms, and other learning sites, and therefore inevitably arouses tensions and negotiations. The discussion in this book puts to the fore the disputable nature of reforming learning and the significance of contextualising the complex relationship between reforms and learning.']",,,,left_only

Over the fairly recent history of the fields of robotics and computer vision a very large body of algorithms has been developed. However this body of knowledge is something of a barrier for anybody entering the field, or even looking to see if they want to enter the field — What is the right algorithm for a particular problem?, and importantly, How can I try it out without spending days coding and debugging it from the original research papers? The author has maintained two open-source MATLAB Toolboxes for more than 10 years: one for robotics and one for vision. The key strength of the Toolboxes provide a set of tools that allow the user to work with real problems, not trivial examples. For the student the book makes the algorithms accessible, the Toolbox code can be read to gain understanding, and the examples illustrate how it can be used —instant gratification in just a couple of lines of MATLAB code. The code can also be the starting point for new work, for researchers or students, by writing programs based on Toolbox functions, or modifying the Toolbox code itself. The purpose of this book is to expand on the tutorial material provided with the toolboxes, add many more examples, and to weave this into a narrative that covers robotics and computer vision separately and together. The author shows how complex problems can be decomposed and solved using just a few simple lines of code, and hopefully to inspire up and coming researchers. The topics covered are guided by the real problems observed over many years as a practitioner of both robotics and computer vision. It is written in a light but informative style, it is easy to read and absorb, and includes a lot of Matlab examples and figures. The book is a real walk through the fundamentals of robot kinematics, dynamics and joint level control, then camera models, image processing, feature extraction and epipolar geometry, and bring it all together in a visual servo system.']",,,,left_only

These individuals often fall into the ‘grey area’ between obvious decisional competence and obvious decisional incompetence and, as a result, may not be recognised as having the legal capacity to make such decisions themselves. At the core of the ethical debate surrounding the participation of cognitively vulnerable individuals in research is when, if at all, we should judge them decisionally and legally competent to consent to or refuse research participation on their own behalf and when they should be judged incompetent in this respect. In this book, the author develops a novel justificatory framework for making judgments of decisional competence to consent to biomedical research with reference to five groups of cognitively vulnerable individuals - older children and adolescents, adults with intellectual disabilities, adults with depression, adults with schizophrenia and adults with dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. Using this framework, the author argues that we can make morally defensible judgments about the competence or incompetence of a potential participant to give contemporaneous consent to research by having regard to whether a judgment of competence would be more harmful to the ‘generic rights’ of the potential participant than a judgment of incompetence. The argument is also used to justify an account of supported decision-making in research, and applied to evaluate the extent to which this approach is evident in existing ethical guidelines and legal provisions. The book will be of interest to bioethicists as well as psychiatrists and academic medical lawyers interested in normative questions raised by the concepts of competence and capacity.

They are so widespread that almost no one can pretend not to have used or suffered the consequences of one of them. In our earlier companion volume, Evaluation and Decision Models, we heavily criticised formal models but we also argued that they could be useful. On the other hand, Evaluation and Decision Models with Multiple Criteria is a guide, a way of reasoning aimed at helping the analyst to choose a model and use it consistently. We propose, often using an axiomatic point of view, a sound analysis of techniques aimed at supporting the decision aiding process. Our presentation is carried out within a unique framework that can be extended to most decision and evaluation models, as a ""decision aiding methodology"". Evaluation and Decision Models with Multiple Criteria is intended for the aware or enlightened practitioner, for anyone who uses decision or evaluation models---for research or for applications---and is willing to question his practice, to have a deeper understanding of what he does. The authors of this book are European academics working in four different universities and research institutions. They teach in engineering, mathematics, computer science and psychology schools. Their background is quite varied: mathematics, economics, engineering, law and geology, but they are all active in decision support and more particularly in multiple criteria decision support. Preference modelling, fuzzy logic, aggregation techniques, social choice theory, artificial intelligence, problem structuring, measurement theory and Operational Research are among their special interests. The authors are active in theoretical research on the foundations of decision aiding, mainly from an axiomatic point of view. Moreover, all the authors have been involved and continue to be engaged in a wide range of applications from software evaluation to location of a nuclear repository, through the rehabilitation of a sewer network or the location of high-voltage lines.']",,,,left_only

By interfacing a photonic reservoir computer with a high-speed electronic device (an FPGA), the author successfully interacts with the reservoir computer in real time, allowing him to considerably expand its capabilities and range of possible applications.

This makes it extremely difficult for women to take care of their own health needs. Women are also reluctant to disclose their HIV-positive status as they fear this may result in physical feelings of shame, social ostracism, violence, or expulsion from home. Women living with HIV/AIDS who are also mothers carry a particularly heavy burden of being HIV-infected. This unique book attempts to put together results from empirical research and focuses on issues relevant to women, motherhood and living with HIV/AIDS which have occurred to individual women in different parts of the globe. The book comprises chapters written by researchers who carry out their projects in different parts of the world, and each chapter contains empirical information based on real life situations. This can be used as evidence for health care providers to implement socially and culturally appropriate services to assist individuals and groups who are living with HIV/AIDS in many societies. The book is of interest to scholars and students in the domains of anthropology, sociology, social work, nursing, public health & medicine and health professionals who have a specific interest in issues concerning women who are mothers and living with HIV/AIDS from cross-cultural perspective.', 'Up until now, many articles have been written to portray stigma and discrimination which occur with people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in many parts of the world. But this is the first book which attempts to put together results from empirical research relating to stigma, discrimination and living with HIV/AIDS. The focus of this book is on issues relevant to stigma and discrimination which have occurred to individuals and groups in different parts of the globe, as well as how these individuals and groups attempt to deal with HIV/AIDS. The book comprises chapters written by researchers who carry out their projects in different parts of the world and each chapter contains empirical information based on real life situations. This can be used as an evidence for health care providers to implement socially and culturally appropriate services to assist individuals and groups who are living with HIV/AIDS in many societies. The book is of interest to health care providers who have their interests in working with individuals and groups who are living with HIV/AIDS from a cross-cultural perspective. It will be useful for students and lecturers in courses such as anthropology, sociology, social work, nursing, public health and medicine. In particular, it will assist health workers in community health centres and hospitals in understanding issues related to HIV/AIDS and hence provide culturally sensitive health care to people living with HIV/AIDS from different social and cultural backgrounds. The book is useful for anyone who is interested in HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination in diverse social and cultural settings.']",,,,left_only

The interdisciplinary collaboration, known as CRYSTAL Atlantique, was sponsored by Canada’s National Science and Engineering Research Council. In this volume, the CRYSTAL participants look back on their collective experience and describe research projects that pushed the boundaries of informal teaching and learning. Those projects include encounters between students and practicing scientists in university laboratories and field studies; summer camps for science engagement; after-school science clubs for teachers and students; innovative software for computer assisted learning; environmental problem-solving in a comparative, international context; online communities devoted to solving mathematical problems; and explorations of ethonomathematics among Canadian aboriginal peoples. The editors and contributors stress the need for research on informal learning to be informed continuously by a notion of science as culture, and they analyze the forms of resistance that studies of informal learning frequently encounter. Above all, they urge a more central place for informal science learning in the larger agenda of educational research today.']",,,,left_only

Addressing why novelists from across the world returned to the epistolary form at the end of the long twentieth century, Bower closely analyses an impressive range of authors to show how and why words travel from I to you.’ — Dr Jonathan Ellis, Senior Lecturer, University of Sheffield, UK ‘This lucid and original book explores the relationships between the epistolary novel, the world and postcolonial literature with a keen, critical eye and a nuanced concern for the material productions of texts, focusing on detailed readings as well as a wider global background. In doing so, Bower both reviews and reforms part of the field, and so this book should be read by those with an interest in the contemporary novel, postcolonialism and literary theory more generally.’ — Professor Robert Eaglestone, Royal Holloway University of London, UK This book examines the striking resurgence of the literary letter at the end of the long twentieth century. It explores how authors returned to epistolary conventions to create dialogue across national, linguistic and cultural borders and repositions a range of contemporary and postcolonial authors never considered together before, including Monica Ali, John Berger, Amitav Ghosh, Michael Ondaatje and Alice Walker. Through a series of situated readings, the book shows how the return to epistolarity is underpinned by ideals relating to dialogue and human connection. Several of the works use letters to present non-anglophone material to the anglophone reader. Others use letters to challenge policed borders: the prison, occupied territory, the nation state. Elsewhere, letters are used to connect correspondents in different cultural and linguistic contexts. Common to all of the works considered in this book is the appeal that they make to us, as readers, and the responsibility they place on us to respond to this address. By taking the epistle as its starting point and pursuing Auerbach’s speculative ideal of weltliteratur, this book turns away from the dominant trend of ‘distant reading’ in world literature, and shows that it is in the close situated analysis of form and composition that the concept of world literature emerges most clearly. This study seeks to re-think the ways in which we read world literature and shows how the literary letter, in old and new forms, speaks powerfully again in this period.']",,,,left_only

Presently, these techniques make full-range 3D data available at interactive frame rates, and thus open the path toward a much broader application of 3D vision systems. The workshop on Dynamic 3D Vision (Dyn3D) was held in conjunction with the annual conference of the German Association of Pattern Recognition (DAGM) in Jena on September 9, 2009. Previous workshops in this series have focused on the same topic, i.e., the Dynamic 3D Vision workshopin conjunction with the DAGM conference in 2007 and the CVPR workshop Time of Flight Camera-Based Computer Vision (TOF-CV) in 2008. The goal of this year’s workshop, as for the prior events, was to constitute a platform for researchers working in the ?eld of real-time range imaging, where all aspects, from sensor evaluation to application scenarios, are addressed. After a very competitive and high-quality reviewing process, 13 papers were accepted for publication in this LNCS issue. The research area on dynamic 3D vision proved to be extremely lively.

Molecular biology and genetics have primarily contributed to this enhanced understanding, which in turn has driven the design of novel rational therapeutic interventions. Auditory Trauma, Protection and Repair presents recent developments in auditory research and their potential translation to the clinical setting. In particular the authors address the major entities of peripheral auditory trauma, discuss the underlying mechanisms, the central nervous system consequences, protective interventions and finally explore the possibilities to restore cochlear morphology and function. Two themes run through the chapters in this book: cellular homeostasis and cell death. In the broadest sense, all auditory pathologies are disorders of cellular homeostasis.

It presents the various steps in the planning and implementation of a TDS and illustrates how TDSs are being used to protect public health from the potential risks posed by chemicals in the food supply in both developed and developing countries. The book also examines some of the applications of TDSs to specific chemicals, including contaminants and nutrients. The goal of a TDS is to provide baseline information on levels and trends of exposure to chemicals in foods as consumed by the population. In other words, foods are processed and prepared as typically consumed before they are analyzed in order to best represent actual dietary intakes. Total diet studies have been used to assess the safe use of agricultural chemicals (e.g., pesticides, antibiotics), food additives (e.g., preservatives, sweetening agents), environmental contaminants (e.g., lead, arsenic, cadmium, radionuclides), processing contaminants (e.g., acrylamide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chloropropanols), and natural contaminants (e.g., aflatoxins) by determining whether dietary exposures to these chemicals are within acceptable limits. Total diet studies can also be applied to certain nutrients where the goal is to assure intakes are not only below safe upper limits, but also above levels deemed necessary to maintain good health. International and national organizations, such as the World Health Organization, the European Food Safety Agency, and the US Food and Drug Administration recognize the TDS approach as one of the most cost-effective means of protecting consumers from chemicals in food, for providing essential information for managing food safety, including food standards, and for setting priorities for further investigation and intervention. About the Editors Gerald G. Moy: For over twenty years, Dr. Moy served as a staff scientist with the World Health Organization and was primarily responsible for the exposure assessment of chemical hazards in food, including coordination of total diet studies at the international level.\xa0 Although retired, he remains active as a food safety adviser for various national and international organizations. Richard W. Vannoort: A senior scientist with the Institute of Environmental Science & Research Ltd (ESR), Dr. Vannoort has been the scientific project leader of the last five New Zealand Total Diet Studies. He is an internationally recognized expert on TDSs and has been a technical adviser to many countries, including numerous international and regional TDS training courses sponsored by the World Health Organization.']",,,,left_only

This is an African customized engagement that parallels the alternative models of China’s “market-socialism” and Latin America’s “21st C Socialism”.

How is employment discrimination law affected by broader political and legal currents? What is the relationship between anti-discrimination law and patterns of social inequality? The chapters in this unique collection grapple with many of these issues. Questions of this scope require interdisciplinary scholarship; and this book includes original contributions from many of the legal scholars, economists, psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, and historians who are at the forefront of new research on discrimination and law.

On other occasions, technological developments outside the military sphere affect or inform the conduct of warfare and military expectations.

Offering a profound discussion of topics such as human identity, our relationship with animals and the environment, and our culture, the author channels the vibrant Italian traditions of humanism, materialism, and speculative philosophy. The research presents a dialogue between the humanities and the natural sciences. It challenges the separation and oppression of animals with a post-humanism steeped in the traditions of the Italian Renaissance. Readers discover a vision of the human as a species informed by an intertwining with animals. The human being is not constructed by an onto-poetic process, but rather by close relati ons with otherness. The human system is increasingly unstable and, therefore, more hybrid. The argument it presents interests scholars, thinkers, and researchers. It also appeals to anyone who wants to delve into the deep animal–human bond and its philosophical, cultural, political instances. The author is a veterinarian, ethologist, and philosopher. He uses cognitive science, zooanthropology, and philosophy to engage in a series of empirical, theoretical, and practice-based engagements with animal life. In the process, he argues that animals are key to human identity and culture at all levels.']",,,,left_only

It calls for the development of flexible approaches, innovative governance and other elements that contribute to effective and adaptive decision-making. Exploring these new approaches is also a challenge for those involved in climate research and development of adaptation policy. Targeted specifically at policy developers and advisors, practitioners, climate knowledge brokers, researchers and interested adaptation decision-makers, this book differs from other titles addressing climate change adaptation and uncertainty by using real life cases to address distinct and pertinent uncertainties in actual adaptation situations. The editors introduce the role of uncertainties in informing adaptation decisions, showing why and how this is important, and why decisions do not have to wait until uncertainties are resolved. They go on to explore uncertainty assessments supporting decision-making on climate change adaptation, with sections on variability, uncertainty typology, climate change and projection of risks. A discussion of national adaptation planning follows with sections on sources and levels of uncertainty, communication of uncertainty and guidance for adaptation planning under uncertainty. The book provides a dozen real-life examples of adaptation decision making in the form of case studies: · Studies on water supply management in Portugal, England and Wales and Hungary · Studies on flooding, including flood risk in Ireland, coastal flooding and erosion in Southwest France and flood management in New Zealand’s Hutt River region · Studies on transport and utilities, including the Austrian Federal railway system and public transit in Dresden, and Québec hydro-electric power · A report examining communication of large numbers of climate scenarios in Dutch climate adaptation workshops The concluding section outlines a new support framework for adaptation decisions under uncertainty, as well as guidance, recommendations and decision support for readers to apply in their own work. In the spirit of the newly adopted EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, the book aims - as does the CIRCLE-2 project from which it emanates - to assist informed decision-making, and to provide added value through increased knowledge sharing.']",,,,left_only

It further connects marketing and advertising as an important link between organizations and its partners; education as a bridge between developing and developed world economies; and growth as a long-term objective of increasing integration at the regional and global level. Through a series of case studies, scholars across the US and France contribute chapters on the manufacturing, marketing, and internationalization of luxury fashion brands, music advertising, the growth of Amazon, and the business landscapes in India, China, Africa, and North Korea. The book provides academic libraries, international business scholars, graduate students, and policy makers with insights and opportunities that enable firms to achieve a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

It is the product of an ongoing effort to know our place in the universe and share with readers the underpinnings of the magnificent cosmos where we are given a chance to exist only very briefly. The essays incorporate a group of challenging ideas that modern physics and cosmology are struggling to understand, in a unique way that incorporates mythological, religious, and philosophical perspectives. The author relies on a simple and powerful philosophy that we are part of the universe and the universe is part of us. \xa0 This wonderful collection of essays provides a journey through the current frontiers of modern astrophysics and cosmology. Its depiction of the most important unsolved mysteries about our place in the Universe is peppered with original insights and philosophical perspectives, making it an intellectual treat. – Avi Loeb, Professor, Harvard University Chair, Astronomy Department; Director, Institute for Theory and Computation \xa0 In these essays, Santhosh Mathew combines an impressive knowledge of physics with an eye to its connection to Eastern philosophy as well as its relevance to our life in modern times. In his thoughtful investigation of natural phenomena and their relationship to universal philosophical truths, he takes up where The Tao of Physics leaves off. You may well find his keen curiosity about the natural world and our place in it infectious. – Carole Bugge (C. E. Lawrence), author of Strings \xa0 In this informative assemblage of engaging essays Santhosh Mathew takes the reader on a deeply human quest for truth, a truly inspiring journey that boldly addresses the big questions of what the Universe is, how it came into being, and where it may be heading. This exciting adventure is as much a rich scientific history of elegant physics, mathematics, and cosmology as it is a philosophical and spiritual pursuit fueled by human imagination. In this age of globalization Mathew recognizes that we need a new and a more whole story, a new epistemology that links our current and cutting edge intellectual scientific understanding of the physical Universe with our deeply spiritual, mystical, and philosophical insights, and he skillfully weaves the foundation for such a story, leaving the reader with a sense of awe, wonder, power, humility, and belonging. – David Morimoto, Division Director, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Lesley University.']",,,,left_only

Yet, because science has the authority to decide which judgments about scientific issues are sound, public concerns are often dismissed because they are not part of the technoscientific paradigm they question.

To support these arguments, it situates science popularization in its historical and cultural context; provides a conceptual framework for analyzing popular science texts; and examines the rhetorical effects of common strategies used in popular science writing. Twenty-six years after Dorothy Nelkin's groundbreaking book, Selling Science: How the Press Covers Science and Technology, popular science writing is still not meeting its potential as a public interest genre; Communicating Popular Science explores how it can move closer to doing so.""]",,,,left_only

The book then goes on to show how Darwin's concept relates to the catastrophic results of the shallow quakes that recently destroyed Port-au-Prince (Haiti, 2010) and severely damaged Christchurch (New Zealand, 2011). In addition, the author asks whether Darwin's ideas are endorsed by the discoveries of modern science and whether the results of destructive earthquakes can be modeled using strongly nonlinear wave equations. Coverage also proposes that similar equations can be used to simulate the dynamics of many objects on the surface of the Earth, and to model the origin of the Universe, dark matter, and dark energy as strongly nonlinear wave phenomena. The book will appeal to students as well as researchers and engineers in geophysics, seismology, nonlinear wave studies, cosmology, physical oceanography, and ocean and coastal engineering. It will also be of use to those who are interested in the phenomena of natural catastrophes as well as those who want to learn more about the life and work of Charles Darwin.""]",,,,left_only

Recent years have witnessed a resurgence of activities especially in developing protocols, identifying genes and mechanisms and large scale commercial take up. The identification of controlling genes has driven functional genomic studies which now dovetail with studies in gene expression, metabolism and changes in cell ultra-structure. World wide take up by plant breeders has been no less impressive, and valuable haploid technologies are increasingly patent protected. The intense activity in haploid research has also resulted in unexpected findings with novel applications. The core of this book is based on the international symposium on ""Haploidy in Higher Plants III"", (Vienna 2006), which attracted top international experts in the field. Other invited contributions have been included to provide a rounded view of activities.

Biological therapies combined with other treatment approaches may be the next X-factor to greatly extend survival time and improve patients’ quality of life. One of the most developed fields in biological therapy is immune therapy, which has stemmed into many branches due to its significance and the tremendous effort by a large population of scientists. Tumor-targeted antibody therapy has been successfully used for treating some types of tumors, and the first tumor vaccine against ovarian cancer has been developed for clinical application. Targeted Cancer Immune Therapy provides comprehensive coverage of novel immune therapeutic approaches, including cytokine therapy, engineered cell therapy, and the application of tumor-targeted antibodies for generating tumor-specific cell therapy, TLR ligand therapy, and cytokine therapy. In the section ""Cytokine Immune Therapy,"" the authors review relatively new cytokine family members, such as the IL12 family, IL18, IL21, IL24, IL28, and IL29, in regard to the anti-tumor function and application in treating tumors. The strategy for targeting and retaining cytokines in the tumor microenvironment is also reviewed. The section ""Cell-based Immune Therapy"" focuses on reviewing ""state of the art"" approaches for engineering potent immune regulatory or effector cells, such as dendritic cells, T cells, and stem cells, for tumor targeting and initiation of tumor specific immune response. In the section ""Targeted Immune Therapy,"" the authors rearticulate antibody therapy for boosting immune response, which includes immunocytokines, ""T-body,"" and tumor targeted CpG ODN. Some or all of these innovative approaches may ultimately become effective future immune therapies for treating malignancy.']",,,,left_only

Conceptual clarifications provide a necessary basis for putting sustainable development into practice. Adaptation and mitigation demand altering both agricultural and consumption practices. Intensive vs. extensive production is reassessed with regard to animal welfare, efficiency and environmental implications. Property rights pay an ever-increasing role, as do shifting land-use practices, agro-energy, biotechnology, food policy to green consumerism. And, last but not least, tools are suggested for teaching agricultural and food ethics. Notwithstanding the plurality of ethical analyses and their outcome, it becomes apparent that governance of agri-food is faced by new needs and new approaches of bringing in the value dimension much more explicitly.

The book offers fascinating insights into both the history of radiobiology and the life of Hal. It contains much unique biographical material made available to the author over the past 35 years by Hal’s contemporaries, many of whom have since died. Great influences on Hal’s life and studies, including his unusual high school, Christ’s Hospital, and his firm moral beliefs, are described. But his life was not merely a gentle, cloistered existence in academia. Its ups and downs included events that would not have been out of place in a Hollywood drama.

A distinct trait of all these applications is that they limit the role of the human element to remote high-level supervision, while placing the burden of the real-time monitoring and coordination of the ongoing activity upon a computerized control system. Hence, any applicable control paradigm must address not only the issues of throughput maximization, work-in-process inventory reduction, and delay and cost minimization, that have been the typical concerns for past studies on resource allocation, but it must also guarantee the operational correctness and the behavioral consistency of the underlying automated system. The resulting problem is rather novel for the developers of these systems, since, in the past, many of its facets were left to the jurisdiction of the present human intelligence. It is also complex, due to the high levels of choice – otherwise known as flexibility – inherent in the operation of these environments. This book proposes a control paradigm that offers a comprehensive and integrated solution to, both, the behavioral / logical and the performance-oriented control problems underlying the management of the resource allocation taking place in the aforementioned highly automated technological applications. Building upon a series of fairly recent results from Discrete Event Systems theory, the proposed paradigm is distinguished by: (i) its robustness to the experienced stochasticities and operational contingencies; (ii) its scalability to the large-scale nature of the target technological applications; and (iii) its operational efficiency. These three properties are supported through the adoption of a ""closed-loop"" structure for the proposed control scheme, and also, through a pertinent decomposition of the overall control function to a logical and a performance-oriented controller for the underlying resource allocation. REAL-TIME MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION SYSTEMS provides a rigorous study of the control problems addressed by each of these two controllers, and of their integration to a unified control function. A notion of optimal control is formulated for each of these problems, but it turns out that the corresponding optimal policies are computationally intractable. Hence, a large part of the book is devoted to the development of effective and computationally efficient approximations for these optimal control policies, especially for those that correspond to the more novel logical control problem.']",,,,left_only

The internet, with its inherent interactivity, and story, with its inherent capacity to engage, can lead to innovative and transformative learning experiences in media-rich environments. This book focuses on web-based Transmedia Storytelling Edutainment (TmSE) as an andragogical practice in higher education. Story is at the forefront of this investigation because narrative is the basis for developing entertainment media franchise that can be incorporated into pedagogical practice. The propulsion of this analysis consists of practice-based research through narrative inquiry and an e-module case study presented on multimedia storytelling in the classroom. A Transmedia Storytelling Framework is provided for creating screenplays for cross-media projects and for analyzing their appropriateness in education. Additionally, a hypertext screenplay, which allowed students to dig deeper into the story word and to build more knowledge, is evaluated for its use in higher education. Since screenplays are by nature writing for the screen, it is believed that the more visual the input, the more likely it is to be memorized and recalled.

This book examines the problems and opportunities of contractual communities, avoiding both the alarmism and unwarranted apologies found in much of the literature on contractual communities. The central notion is that cases in which coercive action by a public agency was deemed indispensable have been unjustly overstated, while the potential benefits of voluntary self-organising processes have been seriously understated.

Killing is clearly antithetical to the Art and Science of Medicine, which is geared toward easing pain and saving lives rather than smothering them. Nevertheless, doctors are people too. Physicians have the same genetic library of enabling qualities and defects as the rest of us, but their vocation places them in a position where both good practice and bad practice can be exercised. The book begins by presenting the background against which medicine came into being and the forces that molded the social, psychological and professional profile of healers. It continues with profiles of infamous serial killer physicians throughout the world; some ""practiced"" over a hundred years ago, others in recent decades. There is a discussion of mass murdering physicians who chose dictatorship or terrorism over healing. Not-so-mad, but highly sadistic physician/ scientists will also be under their microscope. There is a discussion of high-profile cases, and the authors raise the specter of the first genetic homicide - murder by means of chromosomal manipulation. They also the authors also share their thoughts on some of the ethical issues facing physicians today and examine the gray areas between Medicine and Law. The book concludes with a look at current fashions and trends in medicine. Complementary medicine and alternative therapies may have brought relief to many patients, but they have also resulted in disability, suffering, and death. Through the review of a few high profile, drug-related fatalities, the celebrity-physician relationship will be explored. Finally, the authors examine how the doctor is portrayed in fiction and why medical professionals are featured so prominently on television. Dr. Perper and Dr. Cina have a combined medical experience spanning 60 years. As forensic pathologists, they witness death daily and have investigated hundreds of murders. They accept that most doctors are a force for good, but their book contains accounts of horrible atrocities and features descriptions of graphic murders committed by healers. By shining a cold light on the risks patients face today given the wide array of treatment options, the authors aim to accurately relay the circumstances of when, how, and why doctors kill.']",,,,left_only

Through this book, Pennell has broken this logjam. She has taken critical pedagogy, critical literacy, and critical math and put them into practice—with dramatically positive results. Queer pedagogy enabled unlocking all these other approaches and allowed students to make math speak for social justice—a miraculous accomplishment!” —George W. Noblit, Joseph R. Neikirk Distinguished Professor of Sociology of Education at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA “Pennell extends a powerful metaphor in which kayaking represents nuanced social justice work among mostly white and gay-friendly middle schoolers in a literacy and math elective course. In doing so, she challenges teachers and students to draw on their identities as allies, with respect to sexual diversity, in order to develop their identities as allies with respect to racial diversity. In this way, Pennell guides readers to queer curriculum for social justice.” —Mollie V. Blackburn, Professor of Teaching and Learning at Ohio State University, USA This volume explores the value of using queer pedagogy in an interdisciplinary middle school classroom to promote a better understanding of social justice and the social construction of knowledge among students. In the course of the study, which combined student-centered literacy and mathematical inquiries through a social justice lens, students used critical literacy skills to research social justice topics, learned to read numerical data like traditional print text, and created and solved their own math problems. In bringing together critical mathematics and critical literacy through a queer lens, the author offers new ways of thinking that challenges norms and helps students embrace new concepts of learning for the modern era.']",,,,left_only

Offering a unique study of the life and works of Lin Yutang, it highlights his intellectual legacy in modern China and considers how his cross-cultural life and ideas embodied the modern Chinese cultural experience. It notably focuses on Lin’s reputation as an outspoken critic of the infringement of human rights during the rise of the Communist regime in China, but also on his rediscovery of Chinese cultural resources. At a time when China’s cultural c ontributions are increasingly relevant worldwide, this book contributes to ongoing critical reflections of Chinese modernity, particularly in terms of its intellectual legacies, but also to a renewed understanding of the cross-cultural interactions between China and America and a re-opening the dialogue and search for a new cultural understanding.']",,,,left_only

These include host issues, lymph node surgery, radiation therapy, and preoperative systemic treatment requiring specialized knowledge, multidisciplinary care experience, techniques, and research. Locoregional treatment in conjunction with systemic treatments is another important factor, with options for local therapy significantly affected by genetic BRCA mutation. Axillary treatment issues have become top priorities in recent primary breast cancer care, and these are highlighted in the book’s presentation of technological advances in lymph node mapping and diagnosis, axillary clearance in patients with nodal metastasis, and the role of axillary surgery. Attention is also given to locoregional treatment after preoperative systemic therapy. Because therapeutic impact differs depending upon biological characteristics such as tumor subtype, local therapy should be based both on tumor biology and on therapeutic response in parallel. Associated translational research and mathematical prediction tools such as nomograms also are introduced. This book provides the essence of primary breast cancer care, particularly its individualization with novel therapeutic concepts and strategies, and will greatly benefit physicians and clinical investigators in breast cancer institutions.']",,,,left_only

Warin and Zivkovic skillfully balance nuance and broad relevance to shed light on the often-harmful effects of anti-obesity interventions. Their deeply reflexive examination of the social effects of good-intentions holds important lessons for policy makers and ethnographers alike. This is a sophisticated book that changes how the problem of obesity is figured while creatively reworking what counts as a solution.” —Emily Yates-Doerr, Assistant Professor of Anthropology, Oregon State University, USA, and University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands “This is a detailed and insightful ethnographic account of how fatness and obesity are constructed as problems among people living in circumstance of disadvantage in suburban Australia. The authors show how and why a well-meaning programme promoting healthy eating in France was lost in translation in Australia. A must-read for absolutely anyone with an interest in poverty, fatness and health in high income countries.” —Stanley Ulijaszek, Professor of Social and Cultural Anthropology, University of Oxford, UK This ethnography takes the reader into the Australian suburbs to learn about food, eating and bodies during the highly political context of one of Australia’s largest childhood obesity interventions. While there is ample evidence about the number of people who are overweight or obese and an abundance of information about what and how to eat, obesity remains ‘a problem’ in high-income countries such as Australia. Rather than rely on common assumptions that people are making all the wrong choices, this volume reveals the challenges of ‘eating healthy’ when money is scarce and how, different versions of being fat and doing fat happen in everyday worlds of precarity. Without acknowledgement of the multiple realities of fatness and obesity, interventions will continue to have limited reach.

Danger arises when exploration is neglected in favour of exploitation since that may result in an organization which lacks innovation capability. In order to prevent this, an idea has been put forward in recent knowledge management research called ambidexterity, which means the simultaneous and balanced pursuing of both exploration and exploitations activities. Tatjana-Xenia Puhan follows up on this idea by concluding that ambidexterity need not necessarily be implemented in one single organization but can also be realised in a network of associated organizations. The interorganizational ambidexterity is based on co-specialisation: one organisation is devoted solely to exploration while associated organizations focus on their competences in exploitation. Furthermore, the author develops the concept of think tanks as organizations that concentrate on radical innovations while their network associates exploit this newly generated knowledge commercially. Against the background of the hitherto largely inconclusive debate, this work is an outstanding contribution both to knowledge management research and to practical organisational structuring.']",,,,left_only

Each year millions attend sporting events, track the statistics and lives of sports stars, collect memorabilia, engage in fantasy sports, and play various sporting games.

The continued urbanization of human populations, the increasing manipulation of natural resources, and the resulting pollution are driving remarkable burden on water resources. Increasing demands for food, energy, and natural resources are expected to continue to accelerate in the near future in response to the demands of these changing human populations. In addition, the complexity of human activities is leading to a diversity of new chemical contaminants in the environment that represent a major concern for water managers. This will create increased pressure on both water quantity and quality, making it increasingly difﬁcult to provide a sustainable supply of water for human welfare and activities. Although protection of water resources is the best long-term solution, we will also need innovative novel approaches and technologies to water treatment to ensure an adequate superior quality resource to meet these needs. Solving tomorrow’s water issues will require unique approaches that incorporate emerging new technologies. Great advances have been made in the area of nanotechnology. Due to their unique physical and chemical properties, nanomaterials are extensively used in antibacterial medical products, membrane filters, electronics, catalysts, and biosensors. Nanoparticles can have distinctly different properties from their bulk counterparts, creating the opportunity for new materials with a diversity of applications. Recent developments related to water treatment include the potential use of carbon nanotubes, nanocompositae, nanospheres, nanoﬁbers, and nanowires for the removal of a diversity of chemical pollutants. By exploiting the assets and structure of these new materials, such as increased surface area, high reactivity, and photocatalytic action, it will be possible to create technologies that can be very efﬁcient at removing and degrading environmental pollutants. Understanding and using these unique properties should lead to innovative, cost-effective applications for addressing the complexities of emerging needs for water treatment and protection. Although still in the early stages, research into the application of nanotechnology shows great promise for solving some of these major global water issues.

Accordingly, the author offers a comprehensive analysis and detailed historical narrative of the positions of various jurisdictions in relation to communication in the legal process. \xa0As a kind of applied legal history, the book provides an exploration of historical events that were significant in a legal communication context and addresses their implications for modern enactments.

This is also the first time that the phase relations at the relatively low pressures of the lithospheric mantle, mainly applicable to the experimental thermobarometry of metamorphic rocks and mantle xenoliths, are seamlessly integrated with the phase relations of the sublithospheric upper mantle and the uppermost lower mantle, primarily applicable to inclusions in diamond and shocked meteorites.

It's no surprise, then, that the company has been the subject of countless magazine articles, books, and even movies. But despite the extensive coverage that has been given to the company in the years since founder Mark Zuckerberg first took Facebook live on Harvard's server, one question remains unanswered: From a business standpoint, how, exactly, did Facebook do it? How did a college student with no real-world business experience take a relatively simple idea and then, less than ten years later, turn it into a $100 billion dollar company? What specific steps did Facebook take along its journey to creating perhaps the most innovative startup of the 21st century? What approach did it take when pitching venture capitalists, and how did it go about forging its many strategic partnerships? And, most importantly, how can would-be founders learn and effectively utilize Facebook's unique techniques and strategies in their own startup efforts? In How to Create the Next Facebook,\xa0tech guru Tom Taulli answers all of these questions and more, crystallizing the process by which Facebook was shepherded from idea to IPO to provide a guided blueprint for budding entrepreneurs who are ready to start building their own great business. Regardless of what stage of development your startup is in, How to Create the Next Facebook\xa0provides you with clear, compelling, and ultimately actionable advice extracted from Facebook's startup success story.\xa0You'll learn\xa0how Facebook handled the very same situations your startup is confronting—from how it arrived at its mission statement\xa0to what its priorities were during its talent search process—before\xa0gaining access to all the concrete, practical guidance you need to make the right decisions for your company and continue moving forward with confidence. And, of course, because Facebook didn't get everything\xa0right at first, author Tom Taulli painstakingly details the company's most costly mistakes, documenting everything from its protracted legal struggles to its many failed attempts at establishing multiple revenue streams, so that you can arm your company against the various challenges that threaten to sink even the very best startups. By the time you turn the final pages of How to Create the Next Facebook, you'll realize that Facebook is more than just a fun place to catch up with old friends; it is the ideal model to follow for those who, like you, are ready to build the world's next great startup.""]",,,,left_only

It highlights the role of models as mediators between theory and experimentation, and as educational devices, as well as their relevance in testing hypotheses and explanatory functions. The Springer Handbook merges philosophical, cognitive and epistemological perspectives on models with the more practical needs related to the application of this tool across various disciplines and practices. The result is a unique, reliable source of information that guides readers toward an understanding of different aspects of model-based science, such as the theoretical and cognitive nature of models, as well as their practical and logical aspects. The inferential role of models in hypothetical reasoning, abduction and creativity once they are constructed, adopted, and manipulated for different scientific and technological purposes is also discussed. Written by a group of internationally renowned experts in philosophy, the history of science, general epistemology, mathematics, cognitive and computer science, physics and life sciences, as well as engineering, architecture, and economics, this Handbook uses numerous diagrams, schemes and other visual representations to promote a better understanding of the concepts. This also makes it highly accessible to an audience of scholars and students with different scientific backgrounds.

The integrated approach, taking lessons from cognitive linguistics and structuralism, offers a foundation for establishing research and pedagogy that can promote diversity and inclusion in academia. The simplicity of the flexible structure analytical model proposed by Sawaki enables the user to analyse diverse instances of genre. Further innovation is made in the analysis of generic structure components by integrating George Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s metaphor analysis method, so that the model can account for cultural and ideological patterns that structure our abstract thinking. Using these integrations, the author has established a structure analytical model that can take into account linguistic, cognitive, and pragmatic aspects of genre. Researchers in the fields of linguistics, discourse studies, cultural studies, education, and English for Academic Purposes will be able to use this model to identify whether an atypical instance in academic texts is a result of the writer’s individual failure or a failure to understand diversity in academic writing.']",,,,left_only

Through considering how teachers, students and researchers make sense of their worlds, the book explores how some linguistic and socio-cultural locations link to prevalent conceptions of mathematics education. The locations include classroom mathematics, spatial awareness, media images of mathematics, curriculum development, teacher education and mathematics education research itself. The book introduces cutting edge theories of subjectivity that trouble more familiar psychological theories of “humans” apprehending mathematical “concepts”. Rather, it suggests that our senses of self and of mathematics result from self-reflections within the various localities in which we live. In foregrounding subjectivity the book shows how mathematics can provoke alternative ways of thinking towards enlivening our transformative capacities. Learning itself is depicted as participation in cultural renewal, where the very mathematics encountered is becoming something new. Addressing teachers, teacher educators and researchers, the book invites the reader to contemplate alternative trajectories of change into fresh ways of being.']",,,,left_only

This can be seen by looking at the various sources of these publications. Change is produced by the interactions between the various dis- plines.

The material naturally splits into the case of separable Banach spaces, as is treated in the first two chapters, and the nonseparable case, which is covered in the remainder of the book. This book contains new results, and a substantial portion of this material has never before appeared in book form. The book will be of interest to both researchers and graduate students.

This innovative title is the first to offer the elements necessary to consider sex-related properties in both clinical and basic studies regarding the heart and circulation on multiscale levels (i.e. molecular, cellular, electrophysiologically, neuroendocrine, immunoregulatory, organ, allometric, and modeling). Observed differences at (ultra)cellular and organ level are quantified, with focus on clinical relevance and implications for diagnosis and patient management. Since the cardiovascular system is of vital importance for all tissues, Sex-Specific Analysis of Cardiovascular Function is an essential source of information for clinicians, biologists, and biomedical investigators. The wide spectrum of differences described in this book will also act as an eye-opener and serve as a handbook for students, teachers, scientists and practitioners.']",,,,left_only

It deals, in particular, with their formation by means of molecular beam epitaxy and droplet epitaxy of semiconductors, and their topology-driven electronic, optical and magnetic properties. A highly complex theoretical model is developed to adequately represent the specific features of quantum rings. The results presented here are intended to facilitate the development of low-cost high-performance electronic, spintronic, optoelectronic and information processing devices based on quantum rings. This second edition includes both new and significantly revised chapters. It provides extensive information on recent advances in the physics of quantum rings related to the spin-orbit interaction and spin dynamics (spin interference in Rashba rings, tunable exciton topology on type II InAs/GaAsSb quantum nanostructures), the electron-phonon interaction in ring-like structures, quantum interference manifestations in novel materials (graphene nanoribbons, MoS2), and the effects of electrical field and THz radiation on the optical properties of quantum rings. The new edition also shares insights into the properties of various novel architectures, including coupled quantum ring-quantum dot chains and concentric quantum rings, topologic states of light in self-assembled ring-like cavities, and optical and plasmon m.odes in Möbius-shaped resonators.']",,,,left_only

Unfortunately, many consumers have no or little knowledge of budgeting, financial products, and financial planning. It is therefore important that organizations and market authorities know why consumers spend, borrow, insure, invest, and save for their retirement - or why they do not. Understanding Consumer Financial Behavior provides a systemic economic and behavioral approach to the way people handle their finances. It discusses the different types of financial behaviors consumers may engage in and explores the psychological explanations for their behavior and choices. This exciting new book is essential reading for scholars of marketing, finance, and management; financial professionals; and consumer policy makers.""]",,,,left_only
